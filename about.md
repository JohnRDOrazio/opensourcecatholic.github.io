<a href="/sites/opensourcecatholic.com/files/OSC-Logo-1000_0.png"><img src="/sites/opensourcecatholic.com/files/user-uploads/oscatholic/OSC-Logo-250.png" alt="Open Source Catholic - Key Logo" width="250" height="249" style="float: right; margin: 10px; border: none;" /></a>Open Source Catholic was started in 2009 during the [Catholic New Media Convention](http://cnmc.sqpn.com/) (actually, on the plane rides there and back) by [Jeff Geerling](http://www.jeffgeerling.com/), based on some ideas he had discussed with many other Catholic techies over the preceding year.

On this site, Catholics who are interested in discovering and sharing new ways of communicating the Gospel Message of Jesus Christ to the faithful in the Church can do so.

Our logo, which displays one of the keys to the Church (as seen on the Papal coat of arms), was designed by [Tim Canny](http://lappedcatholic.blogspot.com/); he's a graphic designer from Philadelphia who likes to make logos and icons. He would be happy to talk to you about your design needs, and, as evidenced by the logo, he does great work! If you'd like a larger copy of the logo, click on the logo and you'll be taken to a 1000px wide transparent PNG.
