<p>This section of the OSC Wiki will include information about relevant services that provide Catholic parishes, organizations, and dioceses the tools they need to accept and track donations, relate with their donors and customers, and accept payments and registration fees for various purposes.</p>
<p>These services are commonly known as "CRM" or "Customer Relations Management," and there are a variety of service providers in this areaâ€”some are more cost-effective and feature-laden than others.</p>
<p>You might also want to see the more specific '<a href="/node/245">Forms, Registrations, and Event Management</a>' section if you only need solutions for events.</p>
<p>Some of the online providers we know of include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.acceptiva.com/index.html">Acceptiva</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.blackbaud.com/products/fundraising/raisersedge.aspx">Blackbaud / Raiser's Edge</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.convio.com/">Convio</a></li>
<li><a href="http://webconnex.com/">WebConnex</a></li><li><a href="https://www.vancoservices.com/">Vanco Services</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.electronicoffertory.com/site/">Electronic Offertory</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.salesforce.com/">SalesForce</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you're interested in managing your own customer relations website/engine, instead of paying for an outside service, there are two very good CRM solutions built on open source software and technologies:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.sugarcrm.com/crm/">SugarCRM</a></li>
<li><a href="http://civicrm.org/">CiviCRM</a></li>
</ul>
