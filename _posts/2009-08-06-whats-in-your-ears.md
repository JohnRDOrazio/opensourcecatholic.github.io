<p>Since I&nbsp;spend alot of time on wifi in libraries and coffee shops, I&nbsp;bring along my squishy marshmallow green ear buds (http://tinyurl.com/lvojdy) and fire up itunes.</p>
<p>I've got a decent collection of music, but kinda burned out on it. Lately, I've been firing up the iTunes radio stations and for whatever reason kinda getting into electronic music. At the moment, I'm listening to sense.fm progressive. I also like the smoothjazz.com channel.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone else listen to tunes while they work?</p>
<p>What's in your ears?</p>
