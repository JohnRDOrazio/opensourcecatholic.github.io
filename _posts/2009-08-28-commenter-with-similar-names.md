<p>I came across an interesting problem in the blogosphere yesterday.&nbsp; Patrick Madrid wrote <a href="http://patrickmadrid.blogspot.com/2009/08/my-response-to-sr-maureen-fiedlers.html">this blog</a> about a gushy article on Sen. Ted Kennedy's passing.&nbsp; A blog commenter(who apparently often posts on his site not in a malicious way)&nbsp;uses the username &quot;Patrick&quot;&nbsp;and claimed that he doubted that Sen. Kennedy repented of his pro-choice politics before death.&nbsp; Other users and some of the Media 1.0 crowd apparently attributed the comments to Patrick Madrid who's username is &quot;Patrick Madrid&quot; and rebuked him for it.&nbsp; Patrick Madrid clarified it was not him, but I&nbsp;can see this being a tricky situation.&nbsp; What is the best way to handle commenter usernames?&nbsp; Just let it fly or does the blog writer need to make sure they are not being impersonated.&nbsp;I guess another question that comes up from here, is how to prevent malicious commenters who post obscenely or who personally attack others?</p>
