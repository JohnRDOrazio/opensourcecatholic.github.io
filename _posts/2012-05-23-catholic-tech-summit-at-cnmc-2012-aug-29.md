Just wanted to post information about the <a href="http://cnmc.sqpn.com/2012/05/21/cnmc-tech-summit-announced/">Tech Summit</a> that will be held on August 29 at the <a href="http://cnmc.sqpn.com/">2012 Catholic New Media Celebration</a>. The CNMC will be held in Dallas/Fort Worth, and I'll be there along with a bunch of other Catholic web and app developers, talking about new apps and development, API integration, and the future of tech in the Church.

I'm hoping you'll come too!

All the pertinent info about the Tech Summit can be found <a href="http://cnmc.sqpn.com/2012/05/21/cnmc-tech-summit-announced/">here</a>, and you can register for the conference today! Come and contribute to our discussions about things like the open-source <a href="http://www.opensourcecatholic.com/project/catholic-diocese-app">Catholic Diocese app</a>, next-generation Catholic APIs and data sharing, and how we can work together to advance the Church's use of technology, most especially on the web and on mobile devices.
