<p>Jeff&#39;s post here on OSCatholic titled &quot;<a href="http://www.opensourcecatholic.com/blog/oscatholic/what-makes-good-parish-website">What Makes a Good Parish Website?</a>&quot; brought me to brainstorm and design a PowerPoint presentation for clergy and parish staff/volunteers in the Diocese of Sacramento, to get folks moving in the right direction.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, June 1, 2010, I delivered this presentation to ~100 attendees at our first annual diocesan <em>Stewardship Conference</em>.</p>
<p>I recorded the audio on my <a href="http://www.google.com/products/catalog?cid=4286770754533665546">Olympus WS-300M</a> and edited it with <a href="http://www.makepropaganda.com/products.html">Propaganda</a>.&nbsp; Then, I broke the audio into 21 separate files to match the 21 slides of the PowerPoint presentation using <a href="http://www.roxio.com/enu/products/creator/suite/overview.html?AID=10440198">Roxio Creator 2010</a> (this step was a necessary evil, as I discovered).&nbsp; Finally, I downloaded and installed a trial copy of <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CB0QFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.adobe.com%2Fproducts%2Fpresenter%2F&amp;ei=qn4JTOb6OYvQM7agmLYE&amp;usg=AFQjCNHBk2_TjDqPupSg_X42LitG7VlMSA">Adobe Presenter 7</a> to sync each audio file to each slide&#39;s animation and to produce an online copy of the presentation in Flash.</p>
<p>To view the 28-minute presentation, <a href="http://www.diocese-sacramento.org/website">click here</a> or on the screenshot:</p>

<p>I&#39;m hoping that this digital copy of the presentation will make its way into the offices of many diocesan and parish clergy and staff, to assist our Catholic parishes in publishing <em>great</em> parish websites.</p>
