Some are more important than others... here are my top five (based on over 10 years of web development experience, and running five top-million websites (according to <a href="http://www.alexa.com/">Alexa</a>):</p>
<h3>1. Relevant, well-written content</h3>
<p class="rteindent1">People will link more to content that is well-written or fulfills a need. Then not only do you receive direct traffic from someone else&#39;s website, Google picks up on the fact that other people are linking to your content, and your content will have a higher ranking in search results (so, more search traffic as well).</p>
<!--break-->
<h3>2. Great SEO</h3>
<p class="rteindent1">Simply adding good page titles, making sure you&#39;re using H1, H2, H3 tags and HTML markup correctly, and making relevant links (&quot;more about St. Louis&quot; as a link, rather than &quot;click here&quot; as a link, makes Google much more happy) will help tremendously.</p>
<p class="rteindent1">Software like <a href="http://drupal.org/">Drupal</a> is built in such a way that Google and other search engines that crawl the web will more easily identify and categorize the content on your site (thus, higher search engine rankings). (Note: I&#39;ll be posting a detailed review of setting up one&#39;s Drupal site with the RDF + Calais modules soon).</p>
<h3>3. Promotion through many channels</h3>
<p class="rteindent1">Every time a story is posted to our site, it&#39;s sent to <a href="http://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> automatically; this can generate a little extra buzz which gets more visitors as well. But you can&#39;t just spam people&mdash;you need to respond to questions on FB/Twitter, and use social media to not only disperse, but also gather/respond to information.</p>
<p class="rteindent1">In addition to social media, it&#39;s important that you provide <a href="http://www.problogger.net/what-is-rss/">RSS feeds</a> for content aggregation, email subscriptions (if you can), and consider using technologies like <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-rdfa-primer/">RDFa</a> to allow your content to be spread as widely as possible.</p>
<h3>4. Time and Patience</h3>
<p class="rteindent1"><a href="http://archstl.org/">archstl.org</a> has been around since 1998. <a href="http://www.lifeisaprayer.com/">lifeisaprayer.com</a> since 2004. It takes a VERY long time for a website to get much notice or traffic (unless you&#39;re lucky and your site hits digg, slashdot, etc.), and it takes a lot of work to spread the word in a meaningful way&mdash;I always put links to relevant articles/content in my forum posts around the web, I pass around my website address when I talk to people, and I leave comments all over the place with my URL in the &#39;website&#39; field.</p>
<h3>5. Content &#39;gardening&#39;</h3>
<p class="rteindent1">If a story I have is outdated (not a news item, but something that has more lasting value), I will update the page with more information, reorganize the information in a more meaningful way, and track my logs to see into which pages I should put more time.</p>
<p class="rteindent1">(Here&#39;s a good example: <a href="http://www.lifeisaprayer.com/articles/computing/mac-running-slow">My Mac is Running Slow - Help!</a> &ndash; this page has had over 100,000 page views in a year, mostly due to my updating it with relevant new information over time).</p>
<p>These are just a few tips that I think can help anyone (not just Catholics) get many more times the amount of visitors per month than they are currently getting. I would also include good usability, clean markup, a good URL structure, and fast load times (good site/server performance) if the website is anything more advanced than a simple blog.</p>
