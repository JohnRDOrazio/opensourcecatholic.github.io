<p>It looks like the Vatican is going optical! Here are the details, from <a href="http://www.cathnewsasia.com/2010/05/12/vatican-in-major-fibre-optic-comms-upgrade/">CathNews Asia</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Vatican City State has announced a major upgrade to its communications infrastructure including fibre optics links to other Vatican sites including the pontifical villa at Castelgandolfo.</p>
<p>The Governorate of the Vatican City State and Telecom Italia announced the signing of a contract for the installation of the first nucleus of the &ldquo;Integrated Communication Infrastructure for Vatican City State&rdquo;, VIS reports.</p>
<p>This consists in a broadband IP network capable of voice, data and video transmission within the territory of the Holy See and Vatican City State, a communique says.</p>
<p>The plan includes, among other things, fibre optic cable links between the ten main extraterritorial sites including the Pontifical Villas at Castelgandolfo and the radio stations in Santa Maria de Galeria.</p>
