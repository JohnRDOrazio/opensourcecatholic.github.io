<p>There&#39;s a new Twitter hashtag around these parts, for social media use. This hashtag came about as a response to those who were wondering where to move after the bulk of the #cnmc (Catholic New Media Celebration) tweets were becoming less and less about the Celebration, and more and more about general Catholic social media practices and discussion.</p>
<p>Therefore, a general consensus was made that <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23cathmedia">#cathmedia</a> would be a good hashtag for Tweets having to do with Catholic media, and social media initiatives.</p>
<p>Some other hashtags I&#39;ve used:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23catholic">#catholic</a> - for all things Catholic</li>
<li><a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23vocation">#vocation</a> - for vocations-related tweets</li>
<li><a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23pope">#pope</a> - for all things Pope Benedict XVI</li>
</ul>
<p>Are there any other commonly-held Catholic Twitter hashtags everyone should be aware of? Currently, it seems the common practice to put a string of hashtags together for certain topics, like #Catholic #Prayer #Faith... while this is okay to do, it&#39;s best if there are some more specific hashtags which people can add to saved searches (like <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23cathmedia">#cathmedia</a>).</p>
