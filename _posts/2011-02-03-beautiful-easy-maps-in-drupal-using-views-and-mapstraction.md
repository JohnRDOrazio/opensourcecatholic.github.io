<p>I've been asked about the Archdiocese of St. Louis's <a href="http://archstl.org/parishes">online parish search mapping</a> functionality enough times that I finally made a quick video walkthrough of how it was done. The video below explains it allâ€”basically, we use the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/location">Location</a> module to attach addresses to nodes and geocode (get lat/lon) the addresses, and we use <a href="http://drupal.org/project/views">Views</a> + <a href="http://drupal.org/project/mapstraction">Mapstraction</a> to make the spiffy maps all over the site.</p>
<p>The functionality was originally set up by the kind folks at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.palantir.net/">Palantir</a>, and tweaked a bit over time by me to make what you see today.</p>
<p>You can watch the video in HD on Vimeo, to see fine details. (Recorded with iShowU HD).</p>
