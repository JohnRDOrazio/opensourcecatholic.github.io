<p><strong>Other than the Eucharist, of course, what would you want your last mail to be?</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>I'd want to start out with two slices of Buffalo Chicken Pizza, a Dr. Pepper, side of Fritos and cottage chese, and a couple pieces of Jerk Chicken from Bahama Breaze.&nbsp; Then for the main course, I'd want a very large boul of Rivels (potatos, egg noodles, bacon, chicken broth and lots of pepper).&nbsp; So, pretty much chicken and pepper ; )</p>
<p>I'm not much of a dessert person, but maybe a black cherry cola for dessert would be nice to wash everything down with.</p>
