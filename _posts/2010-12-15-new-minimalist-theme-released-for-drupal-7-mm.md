<p>About a year-and-a-half after <a href="/content/open-source-catholic-theme-released-drupalorg">releasing my first contributed theme</a> for Drupal, <a href="http://drupal.org/project/airyblue">Airy Blue</a>, I have finished and release my second contributed theme, <a href="http://drupal.org/project/mm">MM</a><a href="http://drupal.org/project/mm">&nbsp;- A Minimalist Theme</a>.</p>
<p class="rtecenter"><a href="http://drupal.org/project/mm"><img alt="Minimalist Theme Screenshot" src="http://www.opensourcecatholic.com/sites/opensourcecatholic.com/files/user-uploads/oscatholic/minimalist-theme-screenshot.png" style="border-top-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-top-style: solid; border-right-style: solid; border-bottom-style: solid; border-left-style: solid; width: 425px; height: 322px; " title="" /></a></p>
<p class="rteleft">MM is my first HTML5 theme, and my first for Drupal 7 (which, by the way, is awesome!). I have been working on refreshing my LLC website, Midwestern Mac, for the past few months since I scrapped my first hacked-together theme from about 2.5 years ago, and I finally decided to take the plunge and go Drupal 7 for the redesign.</p>
<p>MM is based on <a href="http://drupal.org/project/boron">Boron</a>, an HTML5 base theme that is still in beta for Drupal 7 (thus, I can&#39;t have a final release of my subtheme until Boron is final as well).</p>
<p>The theme has a few nice features:</p>
<ul>
<li>No images whatsoever (cuts down on page load times, since there are less resources to load).</li>
<li>HTML5 markup (tested in IE7-9, FF 3+, Safari 4+, Chrome)</li>
<li>Progressive enhancement - we&#39;re using box-shadow, border radius, and some other CSS3 elements that only work in newer browsers at this point.</li>
</ul>
<p>I figured I&#39;d like to help get more themes on the docket for Drupal 7&#39;s release&mdash;right now <a href="http://drupal.org/project/themes?filters=drupal_core:103&amp;solrsort=ds_project_latest_release_103%20desc">there are very few</a>, and I think it would be nice if people downloading D7 and wanting to tinker could have more than two or three themes to play with.</p>
<p>Plus, it&#39;s just a nice thing to do for an open source project that has given me a career.</p>
