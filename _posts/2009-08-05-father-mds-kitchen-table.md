<p>Father Michael Depcik has a vlog called Father MD's Kitchen Table where he provides a weekly homily in American Sign Language. He also provides common prayers, the rosary, the divine mercy chaplet, and information on saints in ASL. Since I'm learning ASL myself, I watch his vlog every week. You do have to know ASL though -- there's a English summary for each entry, but not a translation.</p>
