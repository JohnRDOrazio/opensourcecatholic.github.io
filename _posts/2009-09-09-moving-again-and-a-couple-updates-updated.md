<p>[<strong>UPDATE</strong>: Everything should be operational again. Please let me know if you have any trouble logging in or posting information!]</p>
<p>Well, after a few weeks on Slicehost, I've decided to switch to a different VPS with a company I've grown to like very much&mdash;Hot Drupal&mdash;and consolidate all my sites onto that system (right now my sites are spread across three different hosts).</p>
<p>Some observations after a couple weeks on the Slice:</p>
<ul>
    <li>64-bit OS memory usage makes a large amount of RAM important, especially when running Drupal or another CMS with relatively high memory usage.</li>
    <li>Even with a bunch of optimizations (like using the Boost module or a reverse-proxy http cache), a 256MB slice can feel very limiting&mdash;and that's with just one site running.</li>
    <li>Unless you want to become a bit of a Linux sysadmin (or at least become familiar with the CLI), don't get a slice or linode, or anything of the sort.</li>
    <li>Slices are more for fun and learning (at least on the low end) than for heavy-hitting high-traffic sites... imo.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since we're moving again, please pardon the dust. In addition, in reference to <a href="/forum/topics/120">this forum topic</a>, I'll be merging Articles and Blogs (eek!) and working to streamline the posting process.</p>
