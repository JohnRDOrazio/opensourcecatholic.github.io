<p>A few weeks back, after finishing a full day of swimming in PHP, HTML and CSS, I was pondering the great mystery of human existence, but probably had a little too much to drink. The result?</p>
<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="Catholic Programmer's Design" height="192" src="http://www.opensourcecatholic.com/sites/opensourcecatholic.com/files/user-uploads/oscatholic/Catholic-Programming-Design.png" title="" width="420" /></p>
<p>You can buy the design on the following products (via Zazzle):</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.zazzle.com/catholic_programmers_t_shirt-235497535568718849">Catholic Programmer&#39;s T-Shirt</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.zazzle.com/catholic_programmers_mousepad-144670862553300061">Catholic Programmer&#39;s Mousepad</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Would you like the design on anything else? I could do a mug, or socks, or anything else in Zazzle&#39;s catalog...</p>
<p>Alternatively, can you think of a way to code this better? ;-)</p>
