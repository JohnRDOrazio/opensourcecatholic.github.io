<p>Was just wondering - does anyone else here do much work with iPhone/Android/other mobile app development? If so, I might open up a Mobile Development forum or something of the like, so we can discuss issues there.</p>
<p>The main reason I'm asking is that the Archdiocese of St. Louis is developing an iPhone app that has a few different features, and it'd be great to have a place where we can collaborate with other Catholic developers (specifically) to discuss issues relating to our Catholic approach to an app...</p>
<p>StackOverflow and other places are great for technical issues, but it'd be nice to be able to discuss things like "how to best find Mass times on a mobile app" or something like that.</p>
