	Simply amazing! Google has been very impressive of late, introducing Wave, Google Voice, and Google Docs improvements. Now they have real-time search, which pushes updates as they happen around the web (from Twitter, Facebook, and other sites) into your search results.</p>
<p>
	Here&#39;s <a href="http://www.google.com/search?esrch=RTSearch&amp;tbs=rltm:1&amp;tbo=u&amp;hl=en&amp;q=google+real+time+search">a sample search result for &#39;Google real time search&#39;</a> - watch for about 10 seconds and you&#39;ll see a steady stream of new results. Then post a Tweet while you&#39;re watching, and prepare to be amazed!</p>
