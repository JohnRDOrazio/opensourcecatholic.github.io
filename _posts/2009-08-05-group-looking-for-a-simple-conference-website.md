<p>A Catholic women's faith group in St. Louis, MO is looking to have a website set up for their conference, similar in form/function/style to this site:&nbsp;http://www.catholicmenforchrist.org/site/</p>
<p>It doesn't have to be anything extraordinary or special, just look nice and work well. I can put you in touch with the group who is hoping to have this website as soon as they can; their conference is in February 2010. Please post here if you're interested!</p>
