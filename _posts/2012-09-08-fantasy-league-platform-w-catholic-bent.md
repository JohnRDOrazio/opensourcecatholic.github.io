I'm looking for a Catholic programmer who is proficient in building sports league fantasy platforms to be used in an educational manner with Catholic undertones.

Familiarity with ASP is a bonus since referencing the pilot program which was developed a number of years ago using ASP on a Unix Server may be helpful.

The Fantasy League Style Platform will be compatibly playable using any online device (smartphone, tablet, laptop, desktop computer) and on all formats (Apple, Android, Mac, PC).

This project is self-funded and will be tested in Catholic schools for free, with potential scalability following positive feedback and strong results, at which point appropriate compensation would be made for previously discounted initial project programming.

Please contact me if interested or with any additional questions--thanks.
