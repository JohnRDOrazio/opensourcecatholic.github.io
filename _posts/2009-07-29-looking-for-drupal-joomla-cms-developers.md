<p>
	I have been contacted recently by a few different Catholic organizations asking for help with various web projects. They (obviously) want to stay within a budget, but are at a loss as to finding a developer who will (a) keep their mission in mind, (b) develop a really slick website and (c) not charge two arms and a leg.</p>
<p>
	Please continue to post your information in the <a href="/forums/services">Services forum</a>, whether you&#39;re looking for (or are available for) work, or you have a job that needs completion. I would love to put someone in contact with an organization or two, and I think that this website is a good means for that!</p>
<p>
	There&#39;s plenty of work available, but I think a lot of times, the problem is simply a lack of channels of communication!</p>
