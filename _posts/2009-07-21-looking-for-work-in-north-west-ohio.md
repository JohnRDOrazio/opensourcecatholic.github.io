<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">About Me:</span> Catholic Christian, Husband, Parent, Graphic/Web Designer, Podcaster, Youth Group Ministry, Member of the Knights of Columbus, and founder of the &quot;Catholic Tech Tips&quot; blog.</p>
<p><br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">What I'm Seeking:</span> I am looking for a Graphic Design Job in the Northwest Ohio area. In the meantime, I am considering small freelance jobs. So if you know of anyone who may need a professional-looking website or blog that they can easily update themselves (once created), please consider me. I also specialize in Web 2.0 Event planning and consulting.</p>

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Why I'm Seeking:</span> I recently found out that I'm losing my job of 8 years. It could happen as early as August 1st or as late as September 1st, 2009. The economy has been hitting our industry pretty hard these past few months (we print promotional items like balloons, mugs, and the such). Combined with a couple of, admittedly, poor business choices on my employer's part, he has decided to sell the company. This means that about 25 employees, including myself will be out of work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I view this as an opportunity to move my family closer to my wife's hometown, but I also am worried about finding a job. Thankfully, we have friends (also a member of the Knights of Columbus) who have offered to let us live with them during this time of unkowingness. My wife will be able to transfer her job, which is really nice. Any prayers you guys can offer up will be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Below, are some of the skills that I have acquired over my years in Graphic Communications. I have worked on both the printing side of the industry, as well as the design side. If you are interested in learning more about my background, work history, and education, contact me and I will gladly e-mail you a PDF version of my r&eacute;sum&eacute;.</p>
