<p>
	Today OSC has been updated to use CKEditor rather than FCKEditor in all the text input areas. CKEditor (at least, in my testing) loads much faster due to rewritten javascript, and looks a little cleaner (dare I say, more OSC-like?) than the aging FCKEditor.</p>
<p>
	I&#39;ve considered using the WYSIWYG API along with TinyMCE, but the dedicated CKEditor module seems to be pretty great.</p>
<p>
	Let me know if you encounter any big problems!</p>
