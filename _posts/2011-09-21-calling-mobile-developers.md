<strong>Update</strong>: I've posted links to some Catholic developers who have responded to this post over on the <a href="http://www.opensourcecatholic.com/wiki/117/mobile-app-development-re">Catholic Mobile App Development Resources</a> page.

I'm going to be giving a presentation on mobile devices at an upcoming Catholic conference, and I'm looking to see if there are any Catholic web developers, programmers, etc. who specialize in app and mobile website development.

I've found plenty of Christian developers, but it seems there is a dearth of Catholic developers (at least, judging by Google search).
