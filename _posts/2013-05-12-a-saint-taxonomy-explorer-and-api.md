I'd like to announce the rollout of <a href="http://www.saintstir.com">Saintstir</a>, which is currently in beta.

<h3>What is Saintstir?</h3>

Saintstir is the world's first online Catholic saint taxonomy. We're creating what can be best described as a genome that categorizes and classifies the saints by various attributes and dimensions, such as their graces/virtues, life experiences, and special powers, to name a few.

The taxonomy itself is extremely flexible and can change with user feedback. We currently have 200 saints and blesseds, but the goal is eventually all saints of the Church.

Additionally, we hope to build communities around the saints by giving people the ability to share testimonies and prayers on each saint's wall on the site as well as on social media.

<h3>Website Integration and API</h3>

We have an extensive API that exposes our search engine to the world.&nbsp; Check out our developers page. There are also easy ways to embed our unique saint tiles on your own webpages or blogs as well.

<h3>How did we get started?</h3>

The concept for saintstir began a couple of years ago when I was trying to find a patron saint for my Catholic confirmation. With so many books in long prose form, it was difficult to find a saint with virtues that I wanted to emulate or particular life experiences that I admired. I finally did find a saint but it was a tough search. If only there were a taxonomy!

Take a look if you have some time and let me know what you think!

God bless,
