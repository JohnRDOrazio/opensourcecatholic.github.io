<p>Recently <a href="http://badgercatholic.blogspot.com/2010/06/new-guadalupe-shrine-director-leif.html">I blogged about</a> a press release that was issued in a Microsoft Word format.&nbsp; Touching on a article I found on <a href="http://www.opensourcecatholic.com/blog/oscatholic/open-source-software-catholic-teac">OpenSourceCatholic</a>, I mentioned even the Vatican says Thou shalt not use proprietary formats.&nbsp; The defense?&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Regarding your comment on needing $150 Microsoft Word to open the press release, you forget that ALL versions of Windows include &quot;Wordpad,&quot; which opens Word documents. While we normally use PDFs, we used a document format so others (like you) would not have retype the information.</p>

<p>A <em>little </em>Microsoft-centric....</p>
