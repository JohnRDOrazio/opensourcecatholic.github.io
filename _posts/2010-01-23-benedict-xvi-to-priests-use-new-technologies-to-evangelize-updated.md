	From Reuters:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
		VATICAN CITY - For God&#39;s sake, blog! Pope Benedict told priests on Saturday, saying they must learn to use new forms of communication to spread the gospel message.</p>
	<p>
		In his message for the Roman Catholic Church&#39;s World Day of Communications, the pope, who is 82 and known not to love computers or the Internet, acknowledged priests must make the most of the &quot;rich menu of options&quot; offered by new technology</p>
	<p>
		&quot;Priests are thus challenged to proclaim the Gospel by employing the latest generation of audiovisual resources &mdash; images, videos, animated features, blogs, Web sites &mdash; which, alongside traditional means, can open up broad new vistas for dialogue, evangelization and catechesis.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>
		&quot;Pope Benedict XVI urged priests over the weekend to use as many tools as possible to communicate with people, which includes the Internet and&mdash;yes&mdash;blogging. The Pope, who has been a bit of an Internet cudmudgeon, acknowledged that &quot;the larger digital world represents a great resource for humanity&quot; and said priests should take advantage of the tool before they become outdated.&quot;</p>
