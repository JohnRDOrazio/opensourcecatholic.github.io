<p><img alt="Reading the Newspaper - by jamesjyu" width="250" height="220" align="right" src="/sites/opensourcecatholic.com/files/user-uploads/oscatholic/reading-newspaper.jpg" style="margin: 10px;" />Just created a new forum, titled &quot;<a href="/forums/traditional-media">Traditional Media</a>&quot; &mdash; the forum is meant to be a place to discuss Catholic newspapers, magazines, television, etc., and most especially ways that stalwarts of the so-called 'traditional' media are moving into the future world of digital convergence.</p>
<p>Some would call traditional media &quot;old&quot; media, but we beg to differ... There is most definitely a place for television programming, news journalism (and I don't mean the run-and-gun blog-style journalism), photojournalism, and printed media in our connected world.</p>
<p>Go ahead and join the conversation in our <a href="/forum">forums</a>!</p>
