We are building a cloud app. I am looking for an experienced PHP developer ASAP who can work with the bit.ly API (http://dev.bitly.com/). You must have experience using Google App Engine or Amazon AWS EC2. This app will include drag and drop interface so AJAX coding experience in a Google App Engine or Amazon AWS environment is also required.
