<p>What are your views on the Tridentine mass?&nbsp; If you don't like it, then what are your views on the coming changes to the Novus Ordo mass?&nbsp; I&nbsp;am not talking about the people invovled.&nbsp; Obviously many people who love the Tridentine mass are a bit too far opposed to the real Catholic Church because they deny that the Novus Ordo is in fact a mass. &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
