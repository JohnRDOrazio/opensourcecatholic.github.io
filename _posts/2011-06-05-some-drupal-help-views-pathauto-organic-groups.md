<p>I am pretty new, but have used this form a number of times. I was wondering if anyone here can help.</p><p>I am trying to create a hackable URL in Drupal 6. I can do it as described here:&nbsp;http://www.masteringdrupal.com/screencast/hackable-urls-drupal-using-pathauto-and-views</p><p>But I would like to do it using a Group Name at the beginning. so a URl looking like this:</p><p>domain.com/blog/catechetics-and-education/4/2011/6/another-post-title</p><p>domain.com/blog/GROUPNAME/UID/YEAR/MONTH/TITLE</p><p>I just can't get views to figure out the group name. I have tried a number of argument tactics, but none of them will pick up the GID or NID from the group name. </p><p>Essentially this would allow me to create a blog for each Organic Group (each having a view), but also allow me to use all of the blog posts in one master view.</p><p>Am I not doing this right, is there a better method?</p><p>I appreciate the help.</p>
