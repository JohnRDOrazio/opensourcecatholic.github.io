<p>Hello, my name is David (DJ) Ortley.</p>
<p>I&#39;m currently unemployed and am looking for work. At the moment, I have a few possibilities for employment in the hopper, but nothing is definite. The type of work that I&rsquo;m looking for would probably either be a quick, one-time contract for a few weeks while something else comes through; or full-time employment, given the possibility that none of the other opportunities may come through. Regarding full-time employment, I&rsquo;m willing to re-locate to most areas if necessary.</p>
<p>The best indicator of my skills would probably be found by looking at my resume, which is located at <a href="http://djortley.com/resume">http://djortley.com/resume</a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not the best graphic artist, and I don&rsquo;t have a lot of experience with eCommerce, but I have fairly strong programming skills coupled with an engineering background.</p>
<p>If you either know of or have anything, contact me at:<br />
dj [at] djortley [dot] com</p>
<p>Thanks.<br />
-DJ</p>
