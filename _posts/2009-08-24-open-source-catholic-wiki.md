Please make sure things inside this wiki are geared towards a general audience (for example, don't speak only about one application of a solutionâ€”or, if you do, broaden its scope by giving more general guidelines to how others might be able to solve the same problem with other solutions).

Always be charitable, and try to reference any sources for your material. Illustrations, when possible, are always greatly appreciated!
