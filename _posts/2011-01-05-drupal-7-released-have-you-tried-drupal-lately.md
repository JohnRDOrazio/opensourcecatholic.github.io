<p>Today, January 5, Drupal version 7.0 was released (<a href="http://drupal.org/project/drupal">download Drupal here</a>). Drupal 7 <a href="http://www.drupal7releaseparty.org/">release parties</a> will be held worldwide on January 7 (which also happens to be my birthday - yay!).</p>
<p>I'll be posting my experiences in upgrading to and extending Drupal 7 both here and on my blog at Midwestern Mac, LLC (see <a href="http://www.midwesternmac.com/category/tags/drupal-7">D7 stories</a>).</p>
<p>Congratulations to the team of <a href="http://growingventuresolutions.com/blog/contributors-drupal-7-final-numbers">almost 1,000 developers</a> who helped make Drupal 7 a reality, and congratulations to <a href="http://buytaert.net/">Dries Buytaert</a>, the founder of Drupal, and <a href="http://www.webchick.net/">webchick</a>, the person who shepherded (and continues herding) the community as the Drupal 7 core maintainer!</p>
<p>This website is still running on Drupal 6 (on a multi-site installation with about 5 other sites), but I'm slowly beginning the process of redesigning and upgrading the rest of my sites (notably, so far, <a href="http://www.midwesternmac.com/">Midwestern Mac, LLC</a>) to Drupal 7. The <a href="http://archstl.org/">Archdiocesan website</a> and <a href="http://stlouisreview.com/">St. Louis Review</a> will take a bit longer, since there's a lot of custom code that needs to be refactored.</p>
<p>If you run a website, have you checked out Drupal before? It's a lot more extensible (in my experience) than Joomla or Wordpress, the two other top contenders. If it's good enough for large sites like the <a href="http://drupal.org/whitehouse-gov-launches-on-drupal-engages-community">White House</a> and <a href="http://drupal.org/node/701104">Examiner.com</a>, it's good enough for you ;-)</p>
