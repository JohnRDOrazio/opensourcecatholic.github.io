<p>Hey everyone,</p>
<p>I&#39;m new here, but I was checking out the Forum postings and saw that there was a lot of love for Drupal/Joomla but I was wondering if anyone used ExpressionEngine, either 1.x or 2.x.</p>
<p>I run a design/development company with my business partner - both Catholic dudes. We do some work for Catholic organizations, and love the people and the work.</p>
<p>We were floating around ModX, Wordpress, and even Concrete5, and then we started using EE and never looked back. The best part for me (as the guy who cuts up my PSD files into semantic HTML by hand) is the control over the code that gets spit out, and the quality of the addons and system extensions. We can build something quick that does everything the client wanted, plus get clean, controlled code.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, I use CodeIgniter when I want to get down and dirty with PHP.</p>
