This forum's purpose is to help those seeking work find it, and those having work to be done to find the work-seekers. If you would like to offer your services—software programming, design, web development, etc.—please post a short bio/examples of your work here, and what kind of interests you have.

If you are looking for someone to help with your project, or if you're looking for someone to fill a position, post the information in a new topic in this forum, along with a contact email address or something along those lines.
