<p>I noticed that there are Christian, Jewish and Moslem plug-ins and collections for Firefox, but nothing that is specifically Catholic.</p>
<p>For example, there's a plugin that calculates prayer times for Moslems, but nothing similar for the Liturgy of the Hours.</p>
<p>There are several bible add-ons, but nothing that specifically gives Catholic versions (although I&nbsp;think a couple might include the New American Bible or New Jerusalem bible among their options.</p>
<p>Is anyone interested in something like this?</p>
