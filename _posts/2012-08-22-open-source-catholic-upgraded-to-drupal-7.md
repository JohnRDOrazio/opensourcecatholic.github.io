At long last, I found some time to upgrade this website to <a href="http://drupal.org/drupal-7.0">Drupal 7</a>. I built this site on Drupal 6 way back in 2009, and have been delaying the upgrade for a while, since it involves a bit of fidgety work.

Anyways, some things may be a little wonky right now, so please pardon any mess and leave a comment here if you find anything seriously broken or missing.

(This upgrade is part of a slightly larger scheme leading up to the <a href="http://cnmc.sqpn.com/">Catholic New Media Conference</a>... more to come!).
