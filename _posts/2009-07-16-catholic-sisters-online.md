<p>We are experiementing with Facebook, Twitter and Blogs. &nbsp;We are also redesigning our website.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any other Sister congregations out there doing the same?&nbsp;I&nbsp;know of a lot doing various things, but wondered if there are others here at OSC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I work with the <a href="http://www.holyfamilysisters.org">Sisters of the Holy Family</a>&nbsp;This is the old site. We will be launching our new site in a week or so. It's so close to finished, I'm getting very excited!&nbsp;</p>
