<p>I&nbsp;am sure most of you are aware of this site and the service, but I&nbsp;just wanted to post this in case there was someone who was not aware of it.</p>
<p>Many people pay alot of money for filtering software when they don't need to.</p>
<p>I&nbsp;use this for my home, between me, my wife and four of our daughters, we have 7 pc's running, not to mention, the Wii and wireless devices. By using this service it filters all devices without any installation software, which is good, because in my home, we use, Windows, Mac and Linux.</p>
