Open Parish is an initiative to improve parish websites and online presences.

<h3>Making Things Better</h3>

Open Parish encompasses some technologies, some ideas, and some tools you can use to make your websites, your social media presences, and your communication better.

<h3>Projects and Initiatives</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://drupal.org/project/openchurch">OpenChurch</a> – a Drupal distribution that can be used to help a parish (Catholic or otherwise) quickly set up a fully-featured website.</li>
<li><a href="http://drupal.org/project/parish_bulletin">Parish Bulletin</a> – module for Drupal websites to help with bulletin management and display on your website.</li>
<li><a href="http://drupal.org/project/parish_calendar">Parish Calendar</a> – module for Drupal websites to help with calendar display and event management and promotion.</li>
<li><a href="http://drupal.org/project/parish_info">Parish Info</a> – module for Drupal websites to integrate individual parish data or diocesan-level parish data into an Open Parish Data directory (still in development).</li>
<li><a href="http://drupal.org/project/parish_theme">Parish Theme</a> – a Drupal theme built specifically for Catholic parishes, compatible with the OpenChurch distribution, that allows color customization.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Examples</h3>

Here are some of the websites that have been built using Open Parish tools and resources:
