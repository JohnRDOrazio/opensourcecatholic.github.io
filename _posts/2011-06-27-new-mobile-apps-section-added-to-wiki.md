<p>Just a little site update: I've added a new <a href="http://www.opensourcecatholic.com/wiki/117/online-mobile-catholic-ap">'Mobile Apps' section</a> to the Open Source Catholic Wiki. Anybody can pop in there and update the list of mobile apps in different categories. I've been meaning to do this for some time, but only had the hour or so to compile this listing tonight.</p><p>I know there are hundreds more apps out there, waiting to be discovered, but I've only put apps up there that I've used or developed. Please add to this section of the Wiki for the benefit of all those looking for great and helpful apps for their mobile devices!</p>
