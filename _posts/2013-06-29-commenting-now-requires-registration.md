Just a quick note: I've disabled anonymous commenting, since it seems the site's finally been targeted by a more dedicated breed of spammers. Even the 1-2 punch of <a href="http://mollom.com/">Mollom</a> and <a href=https://drupal.org/project/honeypot">Honeypot</a> haven't been deterring these 'generic drugs for cheap' spammers lately.

Basically, though, you need an account on OSC to comment from this point forwardâ€”most of the real comments came from logged-in users anyways, and I may consider allowing Facebook/Google/OpenID logins in the future anyways, so this shouldn't be a burden on anyone, hopefully.
