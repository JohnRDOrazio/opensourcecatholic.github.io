<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.roomtopray.net">www.roomtopray.net</a>&nbsp;is my website to encourage people to pause for prayer when browsing and also as a portal to interactive online prayer.</p>
<p>The site is rather basic right now and I have a fair bit of work to do as outlined in the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.roomtopray.net/webhelp.aspx">How You Can Help</a> link.</p>
<p>I have a lot of ideas on expanding the online prayer activities and have set up <a target="_blank" href="http://onlineprayersurvey.questionpro.com/">an online&nbsp;survey </a>to assess people's interest.</p>
<p>I'd appreciate comments on the site and&nbsp;the associated payer activities and ideas on how&nbsp;they can be improved.</p>
<p>One area in particular I'm looking for help on is some sort of web conferencing software; at the moment I'm using TeamSpeak but it requires users to download client software, I'd really prefer something that I can build into a webpage that would just require a login like a forum. Also video/application sharing&nbsp;available for when I introduce seminars and Faith Development programmes.</p>
<p>The web site is&nbsp;running on Asp.net 2.0 with a Sql Express database holding announcements and notices. It is hosted on my own Virtual Private Server running on Windows 2008.</p>
<p>I am currently playing around with DotNetNuke as a possible platform and also playing around with Asp.Net Ajax Components as a way of showing the text of selected prayers.</p>
