<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>Wondering if anyone knows of any religious communities using drupal for their websites?&nbsp; I'm helping some Sisters with their technological presence, and was hoping to give them an option for their website that would make it really easy to update (which makes me lean toward WordPress) but I know Drupal has some outstanding configuration abilities.&nbsp; If you have examples for me, I'd appreciate it.</p>
<p>Bright blessings,</p>
<p>Regina</p>
