<p><u><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline; ">Feast of Our Lady of Mount Carmel,</span></strong></u>&nbsp;traditionally, is a title given to Our Blessed Mother in honor of having give the Scapular of Mount Carmel to Saint Simon Stock. &nbsp;According to a pious tradition the Blessed Virgin appeared to St. Simon Stock at Cambridge, England on Sunday, 16 July, 1251. In answer to his appeal for help for his oppressed order, she appeared to him with a scapular in her hand and said: &ldquo;Take, beloved son, this scapular of thine order as a badge of my confraternity and for thee and all Carmelites a special sign of grace; whoever dies in this garment, will not suffer everlasting fire.</p>

It is widely believed that its general content remains a reliable pious tradition; in other words, that St. Simon Stock was given certain supernatural assurances:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The special protection of the Blessed Virgin for his whole order and for all those wearing the Carmelite habit</li>
    <li>Special aid, especially in the hour of death, to those wearing the habit in her honour throughout life, so that they should be preserved from hell. Indirectly, this promise is extended to all who from devotion to the Mother of God should wear her habit or badge and be thus as if it were affiliated to the Carmelite Order.</li>
