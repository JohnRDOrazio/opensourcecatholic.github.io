<p class="rteleft">I am currently finishing up a design for Mission San Jose Church here in San Antonio, and am having some issues with the navigation system I set up. Any thoughts would be helpful.</p>
<p class="rteleft">I'd suggest looking at these with Firebug to see what the code looks like, because there are a lot of elements at play with this issue.</p>
<p class="rteleft">The problem: In Safari or Firefox, if you check out the beta <a href="http://www.drew-walker.com/sanjose">here</a>, mouseover the &quot;Join&quot; tab and take a look at how the first column of choices is not recognized as hyperlinked, but the second column is. These are both lists, each styled seperately. I'm trying to figure out why the first column of hyperlinked items is not being recognized.</p>
<p class="rteleft">Thanks, friends.</p>
