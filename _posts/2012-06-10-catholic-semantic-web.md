<span>The Catholic Semantic Web could have three key parts that will one day interact.</span>

1) Websites with user information that is machine readable. 'Catholic XML' CXML will provide the readable aspect of this. Developing Catholic XML is part of creating a common standard for Catholic information on the Web.

2) Websites with user information that is machine processable. This would involve developing intelligent agents to process CXML. For example, you have travelled to a foreign city and want to go to Mass. An Intelligent Catholic Agent could automatically work out the available Mass times for you and list them relative to your current location.

3) A computer doing theology? This is part of the Catholic Semantic Web. Natural Language Processign tools have the ability to process text and it is possible to apply those tools to Catholic documents. To be able to process this information in a far more detailed way, Catechism RDF is needed since this markup does not just contain information about the content (eg chapter, paragraph), but the actual relationships in the document are markup up, eg a collusion such as 'bread and wine' would be correctly identified and related to 'Eucharist' with the appropriate link, 'matter' This might be part of a larger sacramental structure. We already have a Catechism XML version (contact us if interested). We suggest developing tools to create Catechism RDF and tools to utilise Catechism RDF.
