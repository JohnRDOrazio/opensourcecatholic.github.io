<p>Hi, we are an open source youth movement (MAYO - Mission Action Youth Organisation) which has our current website using opencore (http://www.coactivate.org/projects/opencore/project-home) on opensource CMS. We are migrating our current site (http://mayostudios.org) to a drupal set up (http://beta.mayostudios.org/) but need help with the mailing list, ie setting up mail server (exim4) in ubuntu&nbsp; and getting it to communicate with 'OG mailinglist' in drupal. Even if it is just some help with exim. It is possible to use postfix or qmail.Please email 'facilitator&nbsp; at&nbsp; mayostudios.org'.</p><p>God Bless</p>
