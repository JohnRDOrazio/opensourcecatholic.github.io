After almost eight years with Open Source Catholic as a Drupal 7 website hosted on infrastructure generously provided by Midwestern Mac, an effort is underway to migrate all the Drupal content into a static Jekyll-powered site hosted on GitHub Pages.

To maintain consistency, and make sure the site is ready for many more years of content and community, we'll be doing some of the following in the coming months:

  1. Migrating existing comments to Disqus.
  2. Migrating existing forum topics and book pages into 'blog' style posts.
  3. Migrating user information into Jekyll so post authorship is maintained.
  4. Ensuring all (or at least most) URLs are redirected to the new Jekyll style correctly.

Please bear with us as this process will likely take a little while (weeks? months?), and some URLs might be affected by the migration.

If you would like to keep track of the development progress or contribute, please check out the [Open Source Catholic](https://github.com/opensourcecatholic) organization on GitHub.
