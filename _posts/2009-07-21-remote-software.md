<p>&nbsp;I've got a client in another state that I'm going to do some remote training with later this week. In the past, I've used Zoho Meeting (free) which has worked OK, but I'm looking for something a bit more robust.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'd rather not use the more expensive stuff like Webex...any other recommendations free/pay?</p>
<p>I'd prefer something OS-independant (Mac/PC).</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
