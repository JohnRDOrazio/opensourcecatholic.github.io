<p>I am looking for a custom web developer to transform my current website (www.thecatholichour.org) into a custom website based on the Wordpress CMS. The end product will most likely be a custom CMS based on Wordpress as my site will require multiple databases. My original webmaster is too tied up to work within my current timeframe of 2-3 weeks to get essential components up and running followed by a Phase II which will require more customized work on the site.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are essential components:</p>
<p>The following feature set would be best for a 1.0 / phase I release:</p>
<ul>
<li>Video Archive</li>
<li>News Articles Archive</li>
<li>Podcast Archive</li>
<li>Article Archive</li>
<li>Paypal Donate Button</li>
<li>Design Integration with Wordpress</li>
<li>Calendar</li>
<li>Contact Form</li>
<li>MailChimp (newsletter) signup</li>
<li>Basic Buddy Press Configuration</li>
<li>Frontpage customization</li>
</ul>
<p>My original web developer relayed that Phase I will cost $500 with an estimated 3 week timeline, although some things should be up and running within a couple of days so I can start adding content quickly He said: &nbsp;&quot;After I get the different components in place on the test site I&#39;ll start working up a design and then implementing the design through the various sections of the site. After the design is in place I&#39;ll move onto customizations to the front page and custom page work such as the donate + contact forms.&quot; That sounds reasonable to me.<br />
<br />
Phase II - III would contain features such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shopping cart</li>
<li>Map Feature (showing where followers are located, locations of calendar events and locations of local Fulton Sheen Societies)</li>
<li>Interactive Calendar</li>
<li>Buddy Press customization</li>
<li>Fulton Sheen Society subsite (small subsite with diffferent header, top navigation, similar layout to The Catholic Hour)</li>
</ul>
<p>Please send me a message if you are qualified and up for the task and we can discuss further.</p>
<p>Thank you and God bless you.</p>
