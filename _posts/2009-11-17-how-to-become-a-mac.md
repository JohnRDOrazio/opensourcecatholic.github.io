<p>So I am thinking of taking the plunge.&nbsp; My 10 year old Dell has served me well but the case is so warped it shorts out if I pick it up to put it in my lap.....!&nbsp; So I was going to go for a new Dell but I&nbsp;thought, maybe, just maybe I would try this fruit thing.... but I know that didn't work out so great for Adam and Eve...&nbsp; Hoping I&nbsp;fare better!&nbsp; Any recommendations on laptops?&nbsp; Anybody else taken the plunge and enjoyed/despised the choice?&nbsp; What do I need to be aware of?&nbsp; I do development work, but most of my open source apps have builds on Mac...&nbsp; I do use Adobe Elements on Windows, I&nbsp;have another machine setup for that, buuuuuut I&nbsp;always have Codex problems when working with some devices.&nbsp; Know how Mac handles Codex for video?&nbsp; </p>
