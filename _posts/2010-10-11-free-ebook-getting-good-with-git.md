<p>To those in software development, version control can be both a godsend and a devilish frustration. <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> solves many of the challenging problems users of systems like SVN and CVS encounter, but it can take a little learning to start using appropriately.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve started using Git for my Archdiocesan web development (see issues for <a href="http://archstldev.com/node/533">setting up Git on a CentOS server</a>, and <a href="http://archstldev.com/node/570">setting up a local development environment for Git/database/file synchronization</a>), and it rocks. So much more so than SVN.</p>

<p>During the month of October, Nettuts+ (an online training site) is <a href="http://net.tutsplus.com/freebies/books/getting-good-with-git-free-ebook/">offering it&#39;s $10 &#39;Getting Good with Git&#39; eBook for free</a>, and I have to say it&#39;s a great Git primer, with a ton of great information, both for those who have never used Git, and those vaguely familiar with Git.</p>
<p>For Drupal developers especially, this eBook is a great find, as <a href="http://drupal.org/community-initiatives/git">Drupal will soon be switching all its code repositories from CVS to Git</a>.</p>
