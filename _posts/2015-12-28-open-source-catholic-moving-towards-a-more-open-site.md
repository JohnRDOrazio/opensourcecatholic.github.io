I just wanted to post an update at the end of 2015; as stated in <a href="/blog/jeff-geerling/future-open-source">The Future of Open Source Catholic</a>, I wanted to find a way to move this site forward, being honest that I probably won't have a lot of time to do much <em>myself</em>.

My main goals in doing so are to ensure Catholic developers and companies who are interested in OSS and an 'open' philosophy in their technological development have a central resource to learn and share ideas and software.

Some of the earliest suggestions have always been to make <em>everything</em> a blog post, and to that end, I'm going to work on a migration from the current site (which is built on Drupal 7 and integrates with Apache Solr search) to a static Jekyll site hosted on GitHub pages.

I've already set up the <a href="https://github.com/open-source-catholic">Open Source Catholic</a> organization on GitHub, inside which the new site content will reside (in a public/open repository, which anyone can fork and contribute to), and I hope that with a little time and some assistance, we can get _everything_, including hopefully all the helpful comments and forum posts, migrated into a new static site.
