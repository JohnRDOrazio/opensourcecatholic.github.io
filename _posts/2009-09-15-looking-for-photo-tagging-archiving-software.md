<p>Howdy folks,</p>
<p>At my day gig, we usually post around 25-50 photos a week online with stories. The images are a mixture of those taken by our staff photographer and also a bunch from istockphoto ($$$).</p>
<p>I've been in the habit of keeping all these images each week with the intention of re-using stuff, however a year later I&nbsp;haven't started and the # of images is huge. Nothing has been tagged either.</p>
<p>I'm now planning on tagging all these photos and trying to setup a search index for them...but I'm looking for the right software for the job (open or proprietary).</p>
<p>Would be nice if it's supported by both Mac and Windows and more than one computer can access/share the index.</p>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>Craig</p>
