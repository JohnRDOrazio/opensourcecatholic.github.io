<p>I'm working with a religious order. They want a Wordpress site for each of their locations, so I suggested a Wordpress Multi-site setup. However, their IT folks have never set this up before apparently, so I am stuck trying to explain!</p><p>Questions:</p><p>1) I wanted each site to have a subdomain of mainsite.org BUT I'm under the impression that subdirectories would be easier for the IT dpt to setup. Am I correct in this?</p><p>2) Once they've done the initial installation, can they just set me up with a Super Administrator user/pass and let me set up the subdirectories? (I don't have access to their root files, etc, via FTP.)</p><p>3) I am thinking of sending this YouTube video (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTgJy-nyDEY&amp;feature=related) along with the Wordpress Codex link to them. Do you have any other suggestions?<span>&nbsp;</span></p><p>Thanks, guys. It's been a while since I've popped my head in here, but I realize how much I missed the nerdy CathMedia talk.</p>
