<p>I am looking for resources/plug-ins to create a kind of Frappr Map. What would be really great would be if I could set it up some how that you need a special password to allow an individual to place a pin on the map. This is for the <a href="http://kck.st/diYY83" target="_blank" title="Kickstarter">"One Voice, One Church (5 Journals Project)"</a> I'd like to be able to track where the journals are traveling to. So, there would be instructions and a password on the inside cover that would allow someone to place a pin on <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msa=0&amp;msid=207999485412981009845.000490420fa7a24907931&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=41.07314,-82.677612&amp;spn=1.538398,3.56781&amp;z=9" target="_blank">the map</a> with the correct color of journal they have in hand. Does this make sense?</p>
