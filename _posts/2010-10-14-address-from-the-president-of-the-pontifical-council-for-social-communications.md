<p>This morning I noticed the following <a href="http://visnews-en.blogspot.com/2010/10/sixth-general-congregation.html">interesting address</a> from Archbishop Claudio Maria Celli, President of the Pontifical Council for Social Communications, to of all places, the 6th general congregation of the synod on the Middle East, which is ongoing now.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Digital culture is present in the various nations of the Middle East and in local Churches through television, radio, cinema, websites and social networks. All this media space has an impact on daily life. ... As indicated in the &#39;Relatio&#39;, it is necessary to train pastoral workers as well as lay people and journalists, but not only them. The formation of seminarians is also a vital issue, not so much as regards technology which they handle better than we do, but as regards communication, which is communion in this rapidly developing culture.</p>
<p>Without priests - and without bishops - who understand modern culture, the communication gap will persist, something which will not favour the transmission of the faith to the young in the Church. It is not sufficient to build websites: what is needed is a presence that is able to create authentic means of communication, that opens &#39;places&#39; where people can gather to bear witness to their faith and to their respect for others.</p>
<p>Obviously this does not mean ignoring personal encounter and physical community life. These are not alternative actions: they are both indispensable for extending God&#39;s kingdom.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well said, and a good exhortation/confirmation for us.</p>
