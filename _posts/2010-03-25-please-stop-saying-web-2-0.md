<p>
	...for the love of everything sacred and holy, <strong>do not use the term &quot;Web 2.0&quot; or say &quot;we are joing the social media revolution.&quot;</strong></p>
<p>
	We are not in some crazy new age of the web, nor are we in a revolution. The Internet is in a constant stage of evolution, and reorganization. There will never be a point at which the web will upgrade to &#39;Web 3.0,&#39; or even &#39;Web 2.1.&#39; So stop using that term!</p>
<p>
	The &#39;Web&#39; is not a software product. It is a relatively new medium by which humans communicate. When television went color, it wasn&#39;t called &quot;TV 2.0.&quot;</p>
<p>
	<strong>Web 2.0 is a buzzword that needs to die.</strong> Any organization that uses this term is dating itself and making the Church look pass&eacute; and behind the times. Instead, say &quot;we are constantly adapting our Gospel message to the latest technologies, and using social media to communicate this message to others on a more personal level.&quot;</p>
<p>
	Of course, if you say this, you have to follow through! Don&#39;t ever be content with where you are. Always innovate, always be adaptable. The world is not a static place, and neither is the Web.</p>
