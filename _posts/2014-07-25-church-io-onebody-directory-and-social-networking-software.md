While browsing Hacker News today, I noticed a neat project by Tim Morgan, <a href="https://github.com/churchio/onebody">OneBody</a>. It is described as a "private member portal for churches" that offers "church directory and social networking" for your Church.

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://church.io/"><img src="/sites/opensourcecatholic.com/files/user-uploads/other/church-io-directory.png" width="600" height="356" alt="Church.IO Directory Screenshot"  /></a></p>

There's a great discussion in the Hacker News thread (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8085213">Show HN: OneBody Church Directory software I've been hacking on for 7 years</a>), and you can get involved with the project (or just download the software) from <a href="http://church.io/">Church.IO</a>.
