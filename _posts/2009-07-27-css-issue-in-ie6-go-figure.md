<p>Howdy,</p>
<p>Here's the short of it: IE6 isn't respecting...(IE7, FF, Opera, Safari, Chrome all do!)</p>
<p>.-icon #searchmod {background:none !important;}</p>
<p>The longer story...</p>
<p>I've got a search module element that is styled and when I assign another custom html element to that position, it's picking up the styling.</p>
<p>So...any suggestions on how to tell IE6 to not style my new element?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>Craig</p>
