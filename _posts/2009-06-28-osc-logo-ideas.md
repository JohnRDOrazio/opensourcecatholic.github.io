<p>It'd be pretty awesome if we could create a great, clean logo to be used for Open Source Catholic. Right now the Twitter account and such all use a simple wordmark (OSC), but a good logo that prints, displays, and looks great would be quite beneficial, I think.</p>
<p>Any ideas for what it should look like? How it should be styled? Please let us know!</p>
