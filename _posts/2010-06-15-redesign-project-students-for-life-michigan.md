<p>From the Students for Life:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We want to redesign <a href="http://www.SFLMichigan.org/">our website</a> so it is more appealing to the eye and integrates social media. Do you know anyone who could help us with this?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Students for Life (MI) website looks to be using ASP right now, but I&#39;m sure they&#39;re willing to do whatever they need to get &#39;social&#39; and update their site. You may notice that their blog page has been hacked at some point&mdash;there&#39;s a ton of Russian spam links in the html...</p>
<p>Interested parties should leave a note in this thread, and I&#39;ll send the contact info your way.</p>
