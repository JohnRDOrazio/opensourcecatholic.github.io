<p>Something I posted on the Archdiocese of St. Louis&#39; <a href="http://archstldev.com/">Development Website</a> earlier today:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As technology has progressed in the past hundred years, the amount of information that is immediately accessible has increased at an exponential rate. As time goes on, people are more and more used to the idea of immediate gratification when it comes to images, text, and stories from events.</p>
<p>There is a new term phrased to wrap up this near-instantaneous stream of live information produced around the world: the &#39;real-time web.&#39;</p>
<p>But what exactly is the real-time web? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_web">Wikipedia</a> can help us here:</p>
<p><em>&quot;The real-time web is a set of technologies and practices which enable users to receive information as soon as it is published by its authors, rather than requiring that they or their software check a source periodically for updates.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Basically, there are many new technologies available today that weren&#39;t even heard of just ten or fifteen years ago, including &quot;RSS&quot;, &quot;XML&quot; and other ways of exchanging information.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What does this mean for you? Well, for your organization to stay at the fore online, and to reach the broadest range of people, you need to be able to participate in this real-time web.</p>
