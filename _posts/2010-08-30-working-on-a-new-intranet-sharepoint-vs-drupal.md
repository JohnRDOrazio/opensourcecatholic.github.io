<p>I&#39;m working on a new Intranet for the Archdiocese of St. Louis, and I&#39;ve been developing in Drupal for the time being (the end-user experience, in my opinion, is crucial to the success or downfall of this Intranet), but the Data Center has offered SharePoint as an option.</p>
<p>Some of the main features are profile pages (with pictures of users), a &#39;dashboard&#39; page on which people will be able to see, at a glance, information they need to see for the day, and Archdiocesan news.</p>
<p>Now, I know everything can be prototyped pretty easily in Drupal, and I have most of the features complete (see a <a href="http://archstldev.com/node/435">dashboard mockup here</a>, along with notes on its implementation). But is SharePoint worth investing some time in?</p>
<p>Does anyone else have any experience with SharePoint? It seems that, in order to simply edit the templates, I&#39;ll need to use a Windows PC and download <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=baa3ad86-bfc1-4bd4-9812-d9e710d44f42&amp;displaylang=en" rel="nofollow">SharePoint Designer 2007</a> (ugh).</p>
