<p>I&nbsp;had installed the Drupal module &quot;bible&quot; which has some great features and included a &quot;public domain&quot; Catholic version based on he Duay-Rheims. I&nbsp;had to remove it, the translation was so bad it is not even funny. I&nbsp;still have it enabled, just not linked.</p>
<p><em>www.catholictuner.com/bible</em>, the developer is in Taiwan here <a href="http://drupalbible.mikelee.idv.tw/">http://drupalbible.mikelee.idv.tw/</a></p>
<p>Does anyone know how to get ahold of the actual text for the Duay-Rheims that is supposedly not restricted by copyrights and add it to this module?</p>
