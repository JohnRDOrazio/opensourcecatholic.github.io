<p>Building your website should be, in essence, no different than building a physical space for your parishioners and constituents to enter. When building a physical space, you must follow certain guidelines for accessibilities, offering wider aisles for wheelchair access, elevators and/or ramps, and other special needs implementations.</p>
<p>When building a website, you should work no less towards inviting and welcoming all of God&#39;s people&mdash;no matter what kind of disability they might have.</p>
<p>This section of the Wiki will introduce you to some aspects of website accessibility and usability that you should remember when building your website.</p>
<p>For now, please read this blog post on the <a href="http://www.opensourcecatholic.com/blog/jeff-geerling/importance-accessibil">Importance of Accessibility on the Web</a>.</p>
