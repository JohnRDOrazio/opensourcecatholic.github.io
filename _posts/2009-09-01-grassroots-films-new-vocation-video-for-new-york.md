<p><a href="http://www.americanpapist.com/blog.html">American Papist</a> has posted this vocations video today.&nbsp; Quite well done, I have seen some of the video technique before from Grassroots Films, specifically that cool effect of blurring part of the picture. &nbsp;&nbsp; Any ideas what software they are using for software?&nbsp; Also, is <a href="http://www.grassrootsfilms.com">Grassroots Films</a> a Catholic company?&nbsp; I see they are based out of New York, so I guess that makes sense they worked on this project.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>If a picture speaks 1000 words, what does that say about video?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many of the web development shops in my area also do video production, ect.&nbsp; With some online newspapers even producing video, has web development gotten to the point where just text isn't enough without audio and/or video? &nbsp;</p>
