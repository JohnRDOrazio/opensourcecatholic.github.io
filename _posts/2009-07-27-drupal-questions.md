<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Joomla admin here, building my first Drupal site...couple questions...</p>
<ol>
    <li>Can you recommend some 'must-have' modules?</li>
    <li>Is there a good 'backup' module that'll backup the db and files?</li>
    <li>Coming from Joomla, you can assign content such as side-bars, modules, etc to specific pages by assigning them to menu items. How do you do this in Drupal?</li>
    <li>Theming - I've seen people discuss using Zen as a base template and then customizing it. Any tutorials on this?</li>
    <li>Any recommended default type settings?&nbsp;For example, I almost always enable global caching and gzip caching in Joomla.</li>
    <li>Lastly, what's the best WYSIWYG editor? Obviously, opinions may vary here!</li>
</ol>
<p>Appreciate any input you can offer!</p>
<p>God Bless,</p>
<p>Craig</p>
