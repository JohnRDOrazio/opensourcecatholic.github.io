	About the Book</h2>
<p>
	Drupal is one of the most respected and widely used open source content management frameworks. Small, medium, and large-scale websites are built using Drupal and the framework supports e-commerce, CRM, multisite and web service integrations.</p>
<p>
	Once you get your Drupal site installed and up and running, you will be concerned with site performance and how fast you can make your Drupal site run. This book will focus on implementing performance modules and solutions to help speed up your Drupal website.</p>
<p>
	We will look at introductory topics such as upgrading your Drupal site, maintaining your site, and enabling core Drupal page compression and caching.</p>
<p>
	Then we will turn to an advanced look at some contributed modules that help speed up performance, including Development, Boost, Authcache, Advanced Cache, and the Memcache API and Integration module.</p>
<p>
	Finally, we&rsquo;ll look at how best to implement a Drupal multisite environment and run it with high-speed performance in mind.</p>
