<p>This may or may not seem like a silly question to a lot of you...&nbsp; Recently my office has needed a video which is already on YouTube to be posted on our web site.&nbsp; Under normal circumstances, we would just embed it, but, as it happens, this particular one is an hour long and we only need the last 30 minutes or so.&nbsp; We would like to download it and edit it, but in looking into this, I was presented with the option of downloading free converter software.&nbsp; Rather than submit my diocesan computer to potential ravishing of malware via unfamiliar and untrustworthy software, I thought I might ask if anyone out there has a solution.</p>
<p>Is there a free converter that you all trust?&nbsp; Or perhaps should I be going about this in a different manner?&nbsp; I will appreciate the input!</p>
