<p>Interesting Quote from the blog &#39;<a href="http://vitaminc.surefireorange.com/2010/why-the-ipad-makes-me-think-of-jesus/">Vitamin C</a>&#39;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How we do this through design is the big question. <strong>Our designs have to reflect Christ.</strong> We do this through demanding people&rsquo;s interest, respect, and most importantly their time through our designs. Christ deserves the best designs possible. I don&rsquo;t know if I speak for all people, but for me to take Church retreats, events, or other ministries serious I want to see that reflected in their designs. If the design is lacking then (in my mind) the retreat must be lacking as well. Just like you wouldn&rsquo;t go to a bank that was tattered and looked unprofessional, I don&rsquo;t want to invest my time in something God related if it comes across as &ldquo;not current&rdquo; or lacks effort.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If we don&#39;t design our websites and software to be as user-friendly, beautiful, and stunning as possible, then we do a disservice to those who use them.</p>
<p>Of course, as I&#39;ve said on my own blog before, modern Church architecture, design, music, etc. seems to be just as sad as modern Church web design. It stinks. Let&#39;s help make that change.</p>
