<p>Seen in St. Louis: The <a href="http://www.stlyouth.org">Office of Youth Ministry</a> is <a href="http://live.stlyouth.org/">live-blogging the 2009 Steubenville St. Louis Mid-America Youth Conference</a>! Pretty snazzy - pictures, videos, audio clips, etc., and viewers can rate their favorite content!</p>
<p>Check it out, and leave feedback for @archstl on Twitter, or in the comments here. Have you live-blogged an event before? Are there any other events that are being (or have been) live-blogged by a Catholic group? It's definitely a way to increase visibility and 'branding.'</p>
