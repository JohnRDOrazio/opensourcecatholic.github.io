	I have been rethinking my podcasts page on CatholicTuner.com. I believe I am going about it the wrong way?</p>
<p>
	I currently have a Content Type specific for Podcasts with fields for the logo, RSS fees, Title, Description and so on. That means that a user must enter all of the info into a node which then gets propagated to a Views page.</p>
<p>
	I don&#39;t know why I never thought of this, but I could just use the Aggregator built into Drupal to import all of this information right from the RSS feed. The problem I am having is how to parse the &lt;image&gt; element from the XML file while holds the url to the image logo of the feed.</p>
<p>
	<br />
	If the feed has iTunes elements, can those be imported?</p>
