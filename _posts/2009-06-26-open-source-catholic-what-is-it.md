<p>...Thus begins a new website. The site was an idea in <a href="http://www.lifeisaprayer.com/">Jeff Geerling's</a> head for about a year, but time was the major constraint holding the site back from actually being made. Now, though, it is time. The website is ready, and hopefully it can be come a hub for Catholics to share solutions and ideas for improving evangelization using new technological media.</p>
<p>You can help improve the website (which is currently in beta), by doing one of a few things:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Post new ideas, stories, articles, and blog entries; this site is all about <em>your</em> content!<br />
    (you'll need to <a href="/user/register">register an account</a>&nbsp;to get started).</li>
    <li>Comment on other people's writings. If you have any suggestions, share them.</li>
    <li>Use the <a href="/contact">contact form</a>&nbsp;or the appropriate section in the <a href="/forum">forum</a> to send in feedback, and thus help us make this website the best it can be.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you're interested in being a moderator (able to remove offensive or spam comments and promote/edit postings, thus allowing the site maintainer to have a life ;-)), please <a href="/contact">contact us</a>.</p>
