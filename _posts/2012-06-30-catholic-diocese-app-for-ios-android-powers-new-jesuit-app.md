Ever since building <a href="http://archstl.org/mobile-app">Catholic STL</a>, an iOS app for the Archdiocese of St. Louis, and then generalizing the code to produce the <a href="https://github.com/geerlingguy/Catholic-Diocese-App-iOS">Catholic Diocese App for iOS</a>, I've wanted to develop a version for Android.

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://www.opensourcecatholic.com/sites/opensourcecatholic.com/files/user-uploads/Jeff%20Geerling/jesuit-app-locations-screenshot.png" alt="Jesuit App - Locations - iOS" title="" width="200" height="300" />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="http://www.opensourcecatholic.com/sites/opensourcecatholic.com/files/user-uploads/Jeff%20Geerling/jesuit-app-news-andoid.png" alt="Jesuit App - News - Android" title="" width="169" height="300" /></p>

A few months ago, the Jesuit Conference contacted me, and finally gave me the ability to do this. Not only was I able to build the <a href="http://mobile.jesuit.org/">Jesuit App</a> for iOS and Android phones (Android version will be on Google Play soon!), but I was able to generalize the code from the Android version to post the <a href="https://github.com/geerlingguy/Catholic-Diocese-App-Android">Catholic Diocese App for Android</a>.

I'll be cleaning up some documentation here and there in the coming months, and I invite any other developers interested in helping to do so—all of the source code and documentation is available on GitHub (links below), and you can follow along with the latest news on the project page: <a href="/project/catholic-diocese-app">Catholic Diocese App</a>.

You can download the Jesuit App from the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/jesuit-app/id528931840?mt=8&amp;uo=4">iTunes store</a> (for iOS) or Google Play (for Android—coming soon!).
