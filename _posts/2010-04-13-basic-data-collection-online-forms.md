	Do you just need to collect information from a certain group of people? You can do this quite simply using a &#39;form builder,&#39; which allows you to set the information people are required to submit. Once a person submits his information, the form that is built will do one or both of the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Send you an email with all of the submitted information.</li>
	<li>
		Store the submitted information in a database for easy viewing, editing, or exporting.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Here are some of the simplest (and often most inexpensive) form building tools:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<strong><a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/">Survey Monkey</a></strong> - One of the oldest, and easiest ways to quickly build a form. Simple forms are free, and you can sign up for a pro account with more features. Doesn&#39;t require any changes to your own website.</li>
	<li>
		<strong><a href="http://wufoo.com/">WuFoo</a></strong> - A newer site/service that allows you to create forms very easily, and even offers more advanced features like PayPal payment integration. Doesn&#39;t require any changes to your own website.</li>
	<li>
		<strong><a href="http://drupal.org/project/webform">Webform</a></strong> - A free Drupal module for form building that is very easy to use and can be extended in many ways, but requires a Drupal website to run.</li>
	<li>
		<strong><a href="http://www.forms-for-joomla.com/">Forms for Joomla</a></strong> - An easy-to-use form builder for Joomla-based websites, similar to Webform, but costing over $20.</li>
</ul>
