<p>Hello, friends.</p>
<p>I'm writing my undergraduate thesis on the Church's need to utilize new media. Exciting, eh? You may be interested in:</p>
<p>- Case Studies: I'm seeking some parishes and ministries who are using, have used, or are planning to begin using new media.</p>
<p>- Literature Search: Got some great bookmarked links on the Church + new media? Sharing is caring.</p>
<p>- Literature Collection: I'd love to know if there are any &quot;libraries,&quot; directories or collections of links to articles about the Church and new media. If a place like this doesn't exist, I definitely think it should. Anyone interested in this type of a project, do get in touch with me.</p>
<p>Do contact me if any of the above interest you, or if you'd like to contribute your &quot;2 cents&quot; to my writing. I would eventually like to publish this piece as a resource.</p>
<p>Peace.</p>
