As more Catholic websites are adding comment forms and feedback forms, the problem of form spam (where you get submissions that are either obviously not written by humans, or submissions that are simply opportunities for people to link back to their own websites) increases.

I wrote a post on <a href="http://www.lifeisaprayer.com/articles/web-design/2011/preventing-form-spam">user-friendly spam prevention techniques</a> that I employ on my websites over on Life is a Prayer.com, and in that post, I talk about the importance of making your spam prevention user-friendly. I specifically write about how detrimental CAPTCHAs are to usability and user happiness.

After you <a href="http://www.lifeisaprayer.com/articles/web-design/2011/preventing-form-spam">read the article</a>, do you have any other ideas or techniques that you use to stop spam and make your users and commenters happy?
