	Good post from Apple about preparing content for the iPad in particular (but is good to keep in mind for most smartphones and touch-based-devices:</p>
<p>
	<a href="http://developer.apple.com/safari/library/technotes/tn2010/tn2262.html">Preparing Your Web Content for iPad</a></p>
<p>
	I always spend a few hours working on sprucing things up for the iPhone, at least, and hopefully soon I&#39;ll be able to test on an iPad as well :-)</p>
<p>
	The big gotcha is HTML5 video. There is a cool player called <a href="http://jilion.com/sublime/video">SublimeVideo</a> from Jilion, but IE support is nil, without the Chrome frame installed. FF, Opera, Safari, Chrome, etc. work great, though. Perhaps we&#39;ll get a good solution where the site falls back to flash if using IE 6, 7 or 8.</p>
<p>
	For now, though, I make sure everything besides Flash works well on the iPhone/iPad OS.</p>
