	<img align="right" alt="Catholic News Live RSS Feed Logo" height="150" hspace="10" src="/sites/opensourcecatholic.com/files/user-uploads/oscatholic/cnl-rss.png" vspace="10" width="150" />I recently launched a new news aggregator website, <a href="http://catholicnewslive.com/">Catholic News Live</a>, which runs atop <a href="http://managingnews.com/">Managing News</a>, a Drupal-based feed aggregator. The site grabs about 50 different Catholic website and blog feeds every three-to-five minutes, and pulls all the stories into the main feeds page.</p>
<p>
	After that, I manually sort the stories into one of many different &#39;channels,&#39; which basically hold stories pertaining to a certain topic. The front page has it&#39;s own feed (with all aggregated stories), and each channel has a feed. In fact, you can even go to the Search page, search for a topic, then grab a feed for that topic!</p>
<p>
	There are a few highlighted searches already, but you can search for whatever you&#39;d like and save that as a feed (kind of like Google News&#39; daily email digest functionality, but more instantaneous).</p>
<p>
	All of this funcationality is built into Managing News (a great all-in-one solution, bye the way), and I&#39;m excited for what the future of the site holds. Right now I have all the &#39;News&#39; channel items feeding into the Catholic News Live Twitter feed (<a href="http://twitter.com/cathnewslive">@cathnewslive</a>) via HootSuite, but I may switch to using the Drupal Twitter module at some point (haven&#39;t decided how much I want to stick in the Twitter stream yet).</p>
<p>
	Does anyone want to help sort the news? At this point, it&#39;s just me, and it can get a little tedious ;-)</p>
<p>
	Also, if you see a feed missing, please comment on this post with a link, or find out how to get your feed added on the <a href="http://catholicnewslive.com/node/1">CNL About pages</a>. You can also grab a badge to display whether your site is featured on CNL from the <a href="http://catholicnewslive.com/node/98">badges page</a>!</p>
