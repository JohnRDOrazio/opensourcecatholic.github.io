Hi, friends. I'm back in action on OSC, wanting your advice.

I work for a non-profit Catholic evangelization apostolate with lots of ministries under our umbrella. Our donor database was written ages ago using MS Access, and it's now a dinosaur. (IOW, not meeting our needs.)

What <strong>Donor Magement / Customer Relationship Management</strong> software have you had experience with / heard of, in a Catholic setting?

We're definitely cash-strapped, but willing to invest in something that will be with us for the long haul.

Thoughts?
