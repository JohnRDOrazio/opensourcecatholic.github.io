<p>I'm working on a site with breadcrumb nav, using the Breadcrumb Navigation XT&nbsp;plugin for Wordpress. But the site uses a static page as the home page vs. the blog home, so when people are on the blog part, they see a wierd Home &gt;&nbsp;Home trail. I've tried modifying the php, but I'm obviously missing something. (My php experience is limited.)&nbsp;Can anyone help me on this?</p>
