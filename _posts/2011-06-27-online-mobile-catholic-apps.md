<p>Catholic Apps have existed for the iPhone, iPad, Android phones and tablets, and other mobile devices since the earliest days they were in production. You can find Apps and services to help you do most anything in your faith life, including finding a priest for confession, assisting you in prayers, and helping you learn about the saint of the day!</p><p>This section of the Open Source Catholic Wiki includes links and information about some of the many Catholic Apps and app developments you can download to your mobile devices.</p>
