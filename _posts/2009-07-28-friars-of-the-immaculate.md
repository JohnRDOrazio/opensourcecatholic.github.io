<p>One of the interesting orders I've run across is the Friars of the Immaculate. They did a live web broadcast from the Shrine of Our Lady of Guadalupe in May on a Marian Co-redemptorix conference (which I&nbsp;delightfully assisted). Here is the video of one of the speakers (<a target="_blank" href="http://airmaria.com/2009/06/19/video-conferences-40-fr-pablo-straub-our-lady-of-guadalupe-and-marian-coredemption/">Fr. Straub</a>) from the conference. (I am hiding at the very beginning of the clip on the right 8-).&nbsp;They have their own <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/user/franciscanfriars">YouTube channel</a> and their outreach website, <a href="http://airmaria.com/">AirMaria</a>,&nbsp;with regular webcasts.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our community is a Roman Catholic religious institute of pontifical rite. Our charism is founded on the spirituality of St. Maximilian Kolbe, which is both Franciscan and Marian.&nbsp; The purpose of this site is to continue in the tradition of St. Maximilian and use the most modern means of communication to promote the welfare of souls by preaching the faith of the Church and making Our Lady known and loved.</p>

<p>A very traditional order with a very modern way of evangalizing! Deo Gratias!</p>
