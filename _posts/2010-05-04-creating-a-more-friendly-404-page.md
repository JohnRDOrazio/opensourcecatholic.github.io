<p>I finally had a little time today to update the Archdiocese of Saint Louis&#39; 404 Not Found page. Drupal has built-in 404 handling, so I simply created a new node, added in the content of the 404 page in the node body, and went to the &#39;site information&#39; page to set 404 errors to that node.</p>
<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="Archdiocese of Saint Louis - 404 Page" height="497" src="http://www.opensourcecatholic.com/sites/opensourcecatholic.com/files/user-uploads/oscatholic/404-page.png" title="" width="600" /></p>
<p>In redesigning the page, I wanted to fulfill two goals:</p>
<!--break-->
<ol>
<li><strong>Make people comfortable, not upset.</strong><br />
The person just hit a missing page, and this threw them off from whatever they may have expected. Best to try to soothe their minds, rather than throw a huge error in their face. Nothing&#39;s worse than the Apache default page, in Times, with black on white. I created the page not found graphic in Photoshop, and added a soft line rather than a hard black horizontal rule.</li>
<li><strong>Offer options to help users stay on the site.</strong><br />
A lot of people will immediately hit the &#39;back&#39; button if they hit a 404. Give users an incentive to stay on the site. I ask them to either search the site, or navigate using the links at the top of the page.</li>
</ol>
<p>Don&#39;t overlook 404 pages, maintenance pages, etc., when developing your website. They are seen by more people than you&#39;d hope, and they are still a good tool for evangelization&mdash;keep people on your site, and comfort them with good design.</p>
