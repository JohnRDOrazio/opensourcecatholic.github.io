<p>One idea that we've been thinking of implementing is the ability for any of our users to set up his own podcast. It's not that hard to enable (basically, they can post 'episodes' of their podcasts as normal blog postsâ€”just attach an MP3, and it will be put into the individual user's blog feed.</p><p>However, I have two concerns about this: 1. My hosting costs - it would be ideal if I had a plain old media server where the file uploads went to; right now, I only have one hosting account, and if some peoples' podcasts get quite popular, my web ecosystem would go down; LOLSaints, Midwestern Mac, and other websites would go down. Does anyone have some online storage space they'd be willing to share, or have any other ideas for ways to implement this?</p><p>The other concern is that of moderation; I wouldn't want someone making anti-Catholic or dubious podcasts. Before I can implement this feature, I'd want to have some of the community aspects of this website to be filled in...</p>
