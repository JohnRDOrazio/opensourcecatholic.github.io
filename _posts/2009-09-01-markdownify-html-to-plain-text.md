<p>I just found a great little PHP utility called <a href="http://milianw.de/projects/markdownify/">Markdownify</a>. &nbsp;It provides a good PHP&nbsp;solution&nbsp;for those times when you want to convert HTML into plain text. &nbsp;For example, I often have clients who create newsletters through a WYSIWYG interface, and Markdownify can create the plain text version very easily. &nbsp;My current use for it is converting the HTML description of an event from an online calendar into plain text for use in an iCal feed.</p>
<p>In case you've never heard of Markdown... it's a plain text formatting syntax, which is very easy to read by itself, and which can be easily converted into HTML. &nbsp;Check out how it works <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">here</a>. &nbsp;There's a PHP&nbsp;version <a href="http://michelf.com/projects/php-markdown/">here</a>.</p>
