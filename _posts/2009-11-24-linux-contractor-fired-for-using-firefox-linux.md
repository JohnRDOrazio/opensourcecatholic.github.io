<p>This is a complicated story but one that must be told. I'm not sure there is anything that can be done about it except rage at the moon...<br />
<br />
But it needs to be told none the less.<br />
<br />
Did I mention it gets complicated?  It does, but it does so for a reason.   Let's introduce the starting lineup.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Players:<br />
<br />
*Our Principal - In the US.<br />
<br />
*An Indian Contracting Company<br />
<br />
*A large computer/server company with three letters in their name.<br />
<br />
*A large credit card company with four letters in their name.<br />
<br />
*A friend of The Principal<br />
<br />
The Principal is a guy who works with Linux Servers for a living. He was contacted by the Indian Contracting Company and asked to apply for a project position through the large company with three letters in their name. The contract was to patch the 1000+ linux servers with some proprietary SAN access software<br />
<br />
With me so far?</p>
