<p>On July 1, it looks like two separate Archdioceses made announcements relating to online evangelization:</p>
<p>Archdiocese of St. Louis&#39; new <a href="http://archstl.org/webdev">Office of Web Development</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In July of 2010, seeing the need for an increasing presence online and in social media outlets, the Archdiocese of St. Louis has created a new office, the Office of Web Development, to help Archdiocesan agencies, affiliated organizations, and (eventually) parishes with their online development.</p>
<p>The Office of Web Development will work in especially close collaboration with the St. Louis Review and the Office of Communications in making sure news and newsworthy stories are delivered online to as many people as possible.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Archdiocese of Boston&#39;s <a href="http://www.bostoncatholic.org/catholicmedia.aspx">New Media &amp; Initiatives group</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>BRAINTREE &mdash; Embracing new and state-of-the-art forms of digital communication to reach the faithful has been a top priority of Cardinal Se&aacute;n P. O&rsquo;Malley.</p>
<p>As part of that effort, effective July 1, the secretariat for Catholic Media will be added to Cardinal O&rsquo;Malley&rsquo;s cabinet. Scot Landry, the current secretary for Institutional Advancement, will become the secretary for Catholic Media and oversee all of the archdiocese&rsquo;s print and digital media including The Pilot&rsquo;s print edition and its website, CatholicTV, the Boston Catholic Directory, Cardinal O&rsquo;Malley&rsquo;s weekly email, the archdiocese&rsquo;s website, the archdiocese&rsquo;s new media accounts including Facebook, Twitter and photo sharing.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Are there any other dioceses getting started (or already well-established) in these areas?</p>
