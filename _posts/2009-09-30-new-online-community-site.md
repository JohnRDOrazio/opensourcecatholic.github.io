<p>&nbsp;Howdy folks,</p>
<p>I've just released a new website into beta:</p>
<p><a href="http://community.thecatholicspirit.com">http://community.thecatholicspirit.com</a></p>
<p>It's definitely a 'work-in-progress', but we're just getting started trying to build an online community. We're also putting in content that's a bit more relevant to 'younger' Catholics.</p>
<p>If you get a chance, drop on by and register, it's free!&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Tech Details:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Based on Joomla 1.5.14</li>
    <li>Utilizing the JomSocial component for community</li>
    <li>Using the MyBlog and JomComment extensions for blogging and commenting</li>
    <li>Kunena forum component</li>
    <li>Affinity Rockettheme Template</li>
    <li>Some other 3rd party extensions (EventList, QuickFAQ, GK NewsPro and few more)</li>
</ul>
<p>On a side note, I did try using the new-ish K2 extension for CCK-style content, but didn't work out the way I wanted. Kinda boiled down to integration issues with the other components. It was a good exercise though, and I'll be implementing K2 in another project that should fit better.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE 11/27/09</strong></p>
<p>Just spent the past 2 days revamping the site.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
    <li>Loaded a new template from Joomlashack.</li>
    <li>Went 'RED'.</li>
    <li>Dropped the Azrul MyBlog and JomComment components and went with a WordPress for Joomla component from CorePHP and incorporated the Disqus commenting tool for articles.</li>
    <li>Removed some of the features that weren't being used such as EventList and QuickFAQ. I might bring them back at a later date though.</li>
</ul>
