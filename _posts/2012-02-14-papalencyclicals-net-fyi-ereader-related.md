From the PapalEncyclicals announcement list:

"With the help of a dedicated volunteer, who has been working hard
converting the encyclicals to eReader formats, the Papal Encyclicals
Online now has hundreds of papal encyclicals in both MOBI and EPUB
formats. So far, we have most of the available documents of the Popes
from Honorious III (1216 A.D.) through Pope Leo XIII (1903 A.D.)
completed."
