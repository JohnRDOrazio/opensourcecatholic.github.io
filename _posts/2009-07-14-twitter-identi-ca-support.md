<p>As per a discussion on Twitter, I really think that oscatholic should add support for Identi.ca alongside Twitter!</p>
<p>It's bit odd for an explicitly &quot;open source&quot; site to support a proprietary web service, but not its open source alternative. Identi.ca may have a smaller audience, but that audience <em>is </em>the open source community.</p>
<p>Plus, Identi.ca has the same&nbsp;API&nbsp;as Twitter. The <a href="http://drupal.org/project/identica">Identi.ca project page</a> on drupal.org just <em>links</em> to the Twitter module, which supports both services.&nbsp;It shouldn't be that hard to add support.</p>
<p>This is a perfect opportunity for oscatholic to lead by example.</p>
