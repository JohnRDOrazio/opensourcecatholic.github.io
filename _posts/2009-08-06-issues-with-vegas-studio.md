<p>So&nbsp;I've kind of been working with Vegas Studio, and I've run into a black screen problem.&nbsp; The project version plays of my video plays, but the rendered version does not. (.mov, .wmv, .avi formats)&nbsp;&nbsp;The rendered video shows up black, but the still screens remain (pictures, text, etc.)&nbsp; Also, the sound is in tact.&nbsp; I don't think it is a codec problem because when I replay the rendered&nbsp;video in Vegas Studio, it doesn't work, either.&nbsp; Any thoughts?</p>
