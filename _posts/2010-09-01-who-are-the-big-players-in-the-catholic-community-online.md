<p>This is a question I&#39;ve wondered for a while, and I figured this would be the right crowd for discussion!</p>
<p>On Twitter you&#39;ve got the &quot;big players&quot; - the people with a ton of influence and followers. There is no &quot;Catholic&quot; category on &quot;People to Follow&quot; on Twitter so we don&#39;t have a canonical version, but who would you say are the big players in Catholicism on Twitter? I&#39;ve seen some tech guys with a great follower ratios, as well as recognizable entities like the Vatican and Diocese - those stand out to me, but maybe not to the Catholic community in general.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
