	Facebook Fan Pages are great for marketing, and are typically used for public relations more than community development. Groups are usually a better option if you want to allow for more discussion, image and video sharing, and have more fine-grained controls over who can have a voice.</p>
<p>
	Many Catholic organizations are already using Fan Pages to great effect. For instance, the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/archstl">Archdiocese of Saint Louis&#39; Facebook Fan Page</a> has close to 1,000 members&mdash;all of whom are notified in their own information streams when the Archdiocese posts an update. Anyone who visits the fan page can click a button to &#39;Become a Fan&#39; of your organization.</p>
<p>
	Some of the benefits of a Facebook Fan Page include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Fan Pages allow RSS feed importing (through Facebook&#39;s &quot;Notes&quot; application), so you can tie in the latest news and postings from your website if you are already utilizing RSS.</li>
	<li>
		Any story or status update on your fan page can be &#39;liked,&#39; shared, or commented upon by followers, and when they do so, all of their friends have the opportunity to see the stories/status updates as well.</li>
	<li>
		Fan Pages have a feature that keeps track of metrics like &#39;post quality,&#39; number of followers, and the fan page audience metrics (like male vs. female visitors), which can be very helpful in determining the effectiveness of your Fan Page use.</li>
</ul>
