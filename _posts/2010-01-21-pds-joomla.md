<p>
	Our parish uses the (now, online/OnDemand) Parish Data System (PDS) software, including all facility and event scheduling.&nbsp; We are also about to roll out a new Joomla-based website.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Does anyone have a good method for calendar export from PDS?</p>
<p>
	The best I&#39;ve found (with the documentation I&#39;ve had so far) for exporting from PDS is HTML output.&nbsp; I&#39;d rather not have to write a script to use that output to create something a bit more portable (e.g. icalendar).</p>
<p>
	Thanks.</p>
