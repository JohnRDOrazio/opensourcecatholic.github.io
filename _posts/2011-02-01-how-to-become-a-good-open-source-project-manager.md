<p>I am not sure where is the best channel to ask this question.</p>
<p>Because I normally work alone or a group of programmers in same location. I don't have any experience about open source project work in group before. However, I would like to improve the quality of the open source project with the helps of the community. So, I would like to know:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to recruit members for open source development from any locations?</li>
<li>Where can I learn the management skill for the open source project? I would like to read more information about this.</li>
</ul>
