<p>Before this century, most event organizers would use many hours of data collection, tabulation, and payment processing time to prepare for a large (or even a small) event.</p>
<p>If you&#39;re looking for more comprehensive solutions for donor management, online customer/parishioner relations management, etc., you may want to tak a look at <a href="/node/361">CRM, Donation Reception, Online Payments</a>.</p>
<p>Nowadays, there is a wide variety of options when it comes to online event planning, registration, coordination, and management. If you want to simply collect data from a certain population, either for a registration or for other purposes, there are many simple ways to do that (some are even built into online content management systems like Drupal and Wordpress).</p>
<p>If you want to dig deeper and allow for much more fine-grained data collection and management of event attendees, or even sell tickets with different levels of discounts and privileges, you can do that pretty easily as well.</p>
<p>This section of the Wiki looks at different options for online registration, forms, and event and ticketing payments.</p>
