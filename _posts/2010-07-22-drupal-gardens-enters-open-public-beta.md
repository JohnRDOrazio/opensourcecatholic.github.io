<p>...and now anyone can set up a fresh, hosted Drupal 7 website in seconds&mdash;for free.</p>
<p>From Dries Buytaert, creator of Drupal, and president of Acquia, the company behind Drupal Gardens (basically, a site like wordpress.com, except with more awesome):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today we&rsquo;ve reached another important milestone at Acquia: Drupal Gardens is now in open beta. No more beta codes. No more waiting to try the service. Now anyone can access Drupal Gardens and create a free Drupal 7 site!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I expect this service, and others like it, to grow in popularity in the coming years. For many parishes, a site on Drupal Gardens would do 90% of <a href="/blog/oscatholic/what-makes-good-parish-website">what they&#39;d need</a> (or 100%, if they weren&#39;t <a href="/blog/carson-weber/parish-website">shooting for the stars</a>...).</p>
<p>And it&#39;s free (for basic plans), community-based, and super-easy to use (the theme developer is especially nice). On top of that, you can, at any time, download your entire site and put it on your own web host!</p>
