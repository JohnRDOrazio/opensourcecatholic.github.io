<p>Amongst a few other architectural changes on the site (disabling some unused modules, cleaning up code in our style files a bit, etc.), I have disabled the OpenID module on the website, meaning the one or two users who were using that for login can no longer do so.</p>
<p>To those users who are now having trouble logging in... email me with your account name, and I'll set up a password for you.</p>
<p>The reasons for doing this are twofold: 1. Only .5% of our users were using OpenID logins, and 2. The module wasn't working that well anyways.</p>
