Many different aspects of Open Source Catholic's resources were mentioned during the course of the 2012 CNMC Tech Summit, on August 29. I've consolidated links to these resources here:

<ul>
	<li><a href="/project/catholic-diocese-app"><strong>Catholic Diocese App</strong></a> (for iOS and Android)
An open source app framework, native to the iOS and Android platforms, for building an app for a Catholic Diocese or Organization.</li>
	<li><a href="/wiki/117/mobile-app-development-re"><strong>Mobile App Development Resources</strong></a>
Some information about developing your own app, working with an outside developer, or using an app platform to quickly build an app.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.opensourcecatholic.com/user/register"><strong>Registration for OSC</strong></a>
Join the OSC developer community to share information about your work and to help the Catholic Church develop better software and websites!</li>
</ul>

You can also <a href="https://twitter.com/OSCatholic">follow @OSCatholic</a> on twitter, subscribe via email in the sidebar, or subscribe to the <a href="/rss.xml">OSC front page RSS feed</a>.

Other things that were mentioned during the day:
