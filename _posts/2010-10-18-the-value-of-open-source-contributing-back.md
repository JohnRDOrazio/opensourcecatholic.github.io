<p><a href="http://www.opensource.org/"><img alt="Open Source Initiative" src="http://www.opensourcecatholic.com/sites/opensourcecatholic.com/files/user-uploads/oscatholic/osi_standard_logo.png" style="border-top-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-top-style: solid; border-right-style: solid; border-bottom-style: solid; border-left-style: solid; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; float: right; width: 225px; height: 258px; " title="" /></a>Today I released my first contributed Drupal module, <a href="http://drupal.org/project/gallery_archive">Gallery Archive</a>&nbsp;(<a href="http://www.lifeisaprayer.com/blog/2010/just-created-new-drupal-module">backstory here</a>). I had already created the Drupal theme <a href="http://drupal.org/project/airyblue">Airy Blue</a> (in use on this site) some time ago, and have created many modules and themes in use on this site and many other Drupal sites I manage. However, it takes a lot more polish, a lot more work, and a lot more long-term dedication to release a module for public consumption!</p>
<p>So, why would I do such a thing? I&#39;m have little time for such projects as it is... and it&#39;s not like releasing a module on drupal.org, thus opening up the issue queue for time-consuming support requests is going to make my life any easier.</p>
<p>Well, I have piggybacked on the success and support of tons of other generous Drupal users over the past two years&mdash;I have gone from being a complete programming newbie to a competent (but still learning) PHP programmer, and I have gone from learning what &#39;node&#39; means to understanding much of Drupal&#39;s node API (which, of course, is all changing again ;-). I have joined <a href="http://www.webchick.net/node/22">thousands of charitable souls</a> who devote quite a bit of time&mdash;personally and professionally&mdash;to making great projects like Drupal stronger... without any compensation besides a &#39;warm fuzzy feeling.&#39;</p>
<p>I feel it&#39;s time I &#39;pay it forward,&#39; as it were. When I read the book &quot;Hackers,&quot; I sympathized with the movement of software developers who wanted to simply create new and amazing things for the betterment of humanity (in my case... humanity <em>and</em> the Church).</p>
<!--break-->
<p>I am committing myself towards moving my theme and new module forward and releasing Drupal 7 versions of both within the year (sooner or later...), and I feel this is a very good use of my time, both as an Archdiocesan web developer, and an individual in the open source software movement.</p>
<p>I would call anyone else out there who hasn&#39;t taken the time to contribute back: please consider doing so&mdash;it will help you become a better programmer/designer, and it will help strengthen the community from which you have received so much already.</p>
