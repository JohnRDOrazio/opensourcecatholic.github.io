<p>We are hoping to create&nbsp; our digital catechesis site from grades k-8 including the entire families.&nbsp; We want it to be charismatic, creative and user friendly while sticking to standards.</p>
<p>We also want to include activities, games and anything that will have families paying more attention together.&nbsp; We are new and just need a lot of advice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I look forward to comments.</p>
