<p>Last night I added a new section to Open Source Catholic - the IRC (&quot;Internet Relay Chat&quot;) discussion area. Simply click on the IRC link at the top of any page, choose a nickname, and join in with other Catholics who want to discuss a wide variety of issues&mdash;pretty much anything goes!</p>
<p>My main focus would be to do things such as allow a few Catholic web developers to collaborate via IRC on a project, or to have an open forum on some important topic. The #OSCatholic channel can also be used as a 'lounge' area for certain large Catholic events - you might find me in there during a Papal event, or during someone's Mass of Installation.</p>
<p>Just be warned: there are many times when nobody's around in the Channel (or just a few people), and sometimes, if you post something, you might not get a response... but if you do, consider it a blessing!</p>
<p>Read through the rest of the <a href="/catholic-irc-chat-channel">IRC page</a> for more information about what IRC is, and how it can help you.</p>
