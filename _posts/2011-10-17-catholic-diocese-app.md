The App is currently being developed on GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/geerlingguy/Catholic-Diocese-App-iOS">iOS</a> | <a href="https://github.com/geerlingguy/Catholic-Diocese-App-Android">Android</a>), and we are currently building a list of developers and development companies that can be contacted for help making the App work for your diocese or organization.
