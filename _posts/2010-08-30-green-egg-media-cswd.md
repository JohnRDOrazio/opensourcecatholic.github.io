<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I wanted to introduce my company - Green Egg Media.</p>
<p>Green Egg Media was started in 2008 by myself and a fellow Notre Dame grad, Lance Johnson. During the last several years, we&#39;ve had the pleasure of working with many Catholic institutions on projects, and really love the people and the mission of the work. We&#39;ve worked with <a href="http://www.focusonline.org">FOCUS: The Fellowship of Catholic University Students</a> on the redesign of their site, EWTN&#39;s <a href="http://www.crossingthegoal.com/">Crossing the Goal</a> on their site, and even <a href="http://www.atiqtuq.com/">ATIQTUQ</a>, a Catholic publisher of bible-themed manga comics. We have also been working with the Diocese of Oakland on a project.</p>
<p>You can find out all about our work and our credentials on our website: <a href="http://www.greeneggmedia.com">http://www.greeneggmedia.com</a>.</p>
<p>We also love Catholic high schools, and we&#39;ve created a blog specifically for Catholic high school staff about designing and maintaining Catholic school websites. That is located at&nbsp;<a href="http://catholicschoolwebdesign.com">http://catholicschoolwebdesign.com</a>.</p>
<p>We really pride ourselves and our company on bringing modern development and design to Catholic institutions, and we are always interested in talking with organizations that have upcoming projects, large or small. Please feel free to email me at adam [at] greeneggmedia [dot] com.</p>
<p>Pax et Bonum,</p>
<p>Adam</p>
