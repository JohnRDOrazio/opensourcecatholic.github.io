<p>&quot;New digital technologies are, indeed, bringing about fundamental shifts in patterns of communication and human relationships... <strong>These technologies are truly a gift to humanity</strong> and we must endeavour to ensure that the benefits they offer are put at the service of all human individuals and communities, especially those who are most disadvantaged and vulnerable.&quot; (<a href="http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/messages/communications/documents/hf_ben-xvi_mes_20090124_43rd-world-communications-day_en.html">Pope Benedict XVI</a>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Recognizing the importance of social networking and more advanced forms of communication that were only dreamed of fifty years ago, we Catholics must advance our evangelistic endeavors to the online realm, through Facebook, Twitter, other social media outlets, and wherever we go. In 2010, <a href="/blog/oscatholic/study-shows-23-churches">only 1/3 of Churches were using any form of social communications</a>&mdash;we hope to help parishes overcome any difficulty of using social media to evangelize and increase the connection between parishes and their members.</p>
<p>Pope Benedict has highlighted the importance of these networks, but also cautions against allowing people to become too dependent remote and online communications:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Those who are active in the production and dissemination of new media content, therefore, should strive to respect the dignity and worth of the human person. If the new technologies are to serve the good of individuals and of society, all users will avoid the sharing of words and images that are degrading of human beings, that promote hatred and intolerance, that debase the goodness and intimacy of human sexuality or that exploit the weak and vulnerable.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, this section of the Open Source Catholic Wiki will allow Catholics involved in the creation and promotion of content and community on the Internet to broaden their knowledge and share the lessons they&#39;ve learned.</p>
