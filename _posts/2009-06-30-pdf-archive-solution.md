<p>&nbsp;Howdy,</p>
<p>I'm working on a project trying to 'webify' a bunch of past newspaper issues that are in PDF format. Now, there are some pretty big $$$ solutions out there...but we're willing to go a bit lo-fi.</p>
<p>For online reading, I've come across <a href="http://www.issuu.com">issuu.com</a> which is a great solution...but that's for going forward. I need to upload issues back to 2001. To make matters worse, this publisher created a separate .pdf document for each page of each issue when they sent it to the printer...that's what I've got to work with.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>
