<div class="visualClear">An XML schema that describes the Catholic Church. It is based on taking the Canon Law document and turning it into an XML. It should ultimately be a namespace run by the vatican.</div>

<div class="visualClear"><span>There is a need to create an XML schema to describe Catholic organisations, from parish, to school, to diocese, to hospital. As more and more Catholic organisations have a web presence and their websites become more sophisticated, there is a need to create a standard way to interchange information. In a diocese, for instance, if each parish uses a common XML for parish information, it will be possible to have a Mass time search engine which will have up to date Mass times. Each parish need only update it's website and a central website could search each registered parish website to find out the Mass times. This is one small example of what is now possible if a common XML were to be established.</span></div>
