<p>I was wondering if anyone has used <a href="http://www.claroline.net/">Claroline</a> before.&nbsp; It is an Open Source eLearning and eWorking platform created by the Catholic University of Louvain, Belgium. I myself have not personally used this software as of yet, though I have noticed that it is not very popular and thus many do not even know about it. I also wanted to let others know about this software, as it can be very useful, especially to instructors.</p>
