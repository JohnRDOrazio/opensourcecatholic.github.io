	After a few months, I am finally able to access the &#39;Diocesan Information Systems Conference&#39; discussions online (it uses some sort of Lotus Notes system), and it&#39;s actually a pretty good resources for IT administrators. There are a lot of great discussions about social networking, network stacks, and information management.</p>
