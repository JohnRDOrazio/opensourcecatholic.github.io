<p>[<em>Some good discussion going on in the forums about video editing software &ndash; OSC</em>]</p>
<p>Can anyone recommend video editing software with a user friendly interface (for PC...)?&nbsp; Our Archdiocese is attempting to do a video contest for the Year for Priests, but to do that we have to have the ability to do at least minor edits.&nbsp; Neither of the two people in our office have had experience with editing, and so far we have found Vegas Studio to be a bit of a headache...&nbsp; We have also tried free online video editing sites, but have found those to be overly simplified.&nbsp; I guess we're looking for something in between... Does anyone have any recommendations?</p>
