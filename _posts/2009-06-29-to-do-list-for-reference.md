To do list (I'm sticking it here, just so it's somewhere ;-):

<ul>
	<li><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Create block for 'social' links - <a href="http://twitter.com/oscatholic">Twitter</a>, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Open-Source-Catholic/97288684164">Facebook</a></span></li>
	<li>Work on guide for updating things, adding content, etc.</li>
	<li>Style forums a little better (especially avatar/name in author pane).</li>
	<li>Make user profiles look nicer (more like a profile page).</li>
	<li>Use taxonomy for company and experience (so people could be sorted by 'PHP', 'Drupal', 'Java', etc. in skills, or by company in the company section).</li>
	<li>Make a profile listing page, and allow companies to have their own pages/listings, along with what services they offer (maybe).</li>
</ul>
