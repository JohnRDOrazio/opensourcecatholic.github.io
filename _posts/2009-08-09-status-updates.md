<p>Just wanted to let everyone know a couple things:</p>
<ol>
    <li>I'm going to be working on moving Open Source Catholic over to the 'official' Airy Blue theme from Drupal.org, rather than a hacked-together version I made while working on the site (sometimes trying to get something out the door fast makes one do it the not-quite-exactly-perfect way). There might be a couple layout bugs here and there in the next couple days.</li>
    <li>The IRC channel has been moved to #oscatholic, as that channel is more for the Catholic tech community, whereas some other channels (such as #Catholic and #romancatholic) are more targeted toward a general audience. If anyone has any good ideas for promoting the channels, let me know!</li>
    <li>Any big projects coming down the pipe for anyone? I know the <a href="http://www.archstl.org">Archdiocese of Saint Louis</a> is working on something pretty big... and will be sharing some of their findings/experiences here!</li>
</ol>
