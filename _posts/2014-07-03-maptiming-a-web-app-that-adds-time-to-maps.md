Hi,

it's a pity that this forum attracts so little attention, because opportunities for leveraging web technologies in the church are plenty...

Here's an announcement of a new app -under development- that may be useful for churches. It's called MapTiming and the idea is to create a web app where you store information about upcoming events or schedules. You store location information as well as calendar date and time. The events are displayed on a map, and can be filtered based on a selected timeframe. MapTiming shows in a glance what's going on, where and when. 

You can follow up on the development on the blog and this article tells exactly why churches can benefit:

Best regards,
Vic
