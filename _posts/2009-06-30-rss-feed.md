<p>&nbsp;Hey Jeff,</p>
<p>How often does your site feed update? I subscribed this afternoon in Google Reader and nothing since then has shown up, but there's alot of new content.</p>
<p>Does the feed include all forum posts as well?</p>
<p>Also...is it possible to get an email update when an article/forum post I've commented on get's another comment?</p>
