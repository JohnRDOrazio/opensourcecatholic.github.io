<p>An idea I&#39;ve been having in the back of my mind for some time is putting the Rosary (or another devotional) online in such a way as to (a) faithfully instruct individuals on the purpose and beauty in its prayer, and (b) stretch my skills and build a usable, friendly, and prayerful web application.</p>
<p>I envision building a standards-compliant/HTML5 site which leads a Catholic through the recitation of the Holy Rosary, or maybe the Chaplet of Divine Mercy, and works across as many modern browsers as is possible, without Flash, and without any of the &#39;cheese factor&#39; that I see on many other similar projects...</p>
<p>Would anyone else be interested in collaborating in a project like this? I will probably do a little here, a little there, as I don&#39;t have a lot of time on my hands right now :)</p>
