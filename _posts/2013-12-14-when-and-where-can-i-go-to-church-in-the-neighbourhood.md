Hi,

If you ever need to do something with maps, make sure to look at Google Fusion Tables. I've used them to create a web app where you can look up on the map where in the neighborhood you can go to mass. You can filter to look for masses that start immediately, that start later today or that take place tomorrow. On clicking a church, you get a view of all scheduled masses.

Here are some links:

(you'll have to navigate to Belgium to see some results)

Best regards,
