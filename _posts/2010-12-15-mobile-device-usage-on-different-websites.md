<p>I have recently been advancing my work in mobile theming and architecture for a few different websites, as I agree with many others who have said before that the web will become mobile (meaning it needs to display equally well on a smartphone, a tablet, and the desktop) in the next 5-10 years... and we need to be ready for that!</p>
<p>Here are some device usage statistics for the past month on a variety of websites I maintain (I only mention the top three - Blackberry, Symbian, etc. are too low to worry about them at this point):</p>
<h4><a href="http://archstl.org/">Archdiocese of St. Louis</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>iPhone - 1,253 visits, 2.43 pages/visit</li>
<li>Android - 434 visits, 2.76 pages/visit</li>
<li>iPad - 296 visits, 3.98 pages/visit</li>
</ul>
<h4><a href="http://stlouisreview.com/">St. Louis Review</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>iPhone - 479 visits, 1.74 pages/visit</li>
<li>Android - 171 visits, 1.57 pages/visit</li>
<li>iPad - 148 visits, 2.45 pages/visit</li>
</ul>

<h4><a href="http://www.lifeisaprayer.com/">Life is a Prayer.com</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>iPhone - 1,401 visits, 1.47 pages/visit</li>
<li>iPad - 1,106 visits, 1.35 pages/visit</li>
<li>Android - 200 visits, 1.10 pages/visit</li>
</ul>
<h4><a href="/">Open Source Catholic</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>iPad - 42 visits, 1.64 pages/visit</li>
<li>iPhone - 33 visits, 1.27 pages/visit</li>
<li>iPhone - 18 visits, 1.11 pages/visit</li>
</ul>
<p>It&#39;s interesting to me that Android is nowhere near touching the iOS crown, though Google keeps bragging that they have a much, much larger proportion of handsets sold. I think this simply shows that iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch users (who are almost always in fourth place) are much more prone to visiting websites on their phones.</p>
<p>Blackberry is usually the only solid bottom-of-the-barrel contender, but Blackberry usually only has maybe a 1-2% share across all my sites.</p>
<p>The sites with the most Android users were those that cater to older/less-technical audiences. All the sites with more tech-savvy audiences are visited most often by iOS devices. Of course, all these sites are localized to North America, so that has a little bit to do with the slant away from Symbian...</p>
<p>What are your numbers for mobile browsers?</p>
