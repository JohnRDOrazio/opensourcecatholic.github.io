<p class="rteleft">Despite Microsoft including Internet Explorer in all its operating systems, people are installing FireFox as their default browser at an astonishing rate. I take pride in the fact that all but two of the sites I help maintain have already seen FireFox (and sometimes even Safari) overtake Explorer (all versions combined) as the most used browser.</p>
<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="FireFox overtakes IE Marketshare - Analytics" width="600" height="273" src="/sites/opensourcecatholic.com/files/user-uploads/oscatholic/osc-firefox-share.jpg" /></p>
<p class="rtecenter"><em>FireFox far surpasses IE on any even remotely tech-oriented website.</em></p>
<p class="rteleft">The sites that still get more Explorer traffic are parish and Archdiocesan websites (which are typically visited by an older demographic, and/or people who are using office computers).</p>
<p class="rteleft">Germany, apparently, is the first country in which <a href="http://thenextweb.com/europe/2009/12/02/congratulations-mozilla-firefox-overtakes-internet-explorer-germany/">Explorer's long-standing crown as the most-used browser has been taken away</a> by FireFox.</p>
<p class="rteleft">Of course, having 99% of the web use FireFox would be just as bad as 99% using Internet Explorer. I'm hoping Safari, Chrome, FireFox, and Internet Explorer all stay around awhile and help spark more innovation and speed in the browser arena.</p>
<p class="rteleft">Are you still using Internet Explorer? Why? The only thing I've used it for in the past two years is to test sites and make sure they work for the underprivileged part of the population who is forced (willingly or no) into using the sadness that is IE 6, 7 or even 8. Hopefully 9 will be an improvement... but it might be too little too late.</p>
