<p>Since the beginning of this website, we&#39;ve had a <a href="/tweets/all">Twitter</a> page that shows all tweets from Open Source Catholic members who choose to allow OSC to show their tweets.</p>
<p>In the past, we used a simple authentication system that worked great before <a href="http://blog.twitter.com/2010/08/twitter-applications-and-oauth.html">Twitter switched to using OAuth</a> only... after dragging our feet for a while, we finally took the time to get OAuth and Twitter working correctly on this site again.</p>
<p>This means that you can add your twitter account to your OSC account, by simply visiting your &#39;<a href="/user">My account</a>&#39; page, clicking &#39;Edit,&#39; then clicking on &#39;Twitter accounts.&#39; Click the &#39;Add account&#39; button to add your Twitter account, and voila! Your tweets will start showing up in the global Twitter page.</p>
<p>Also, you can choose to post any blog entry on this site to the <a href="http://twitter.com/oscatholic">@oscatholic</a> Twitter account if you so choose&mdash;use this feature with discretion, though, as it&#39;s liable to be taken away if it&#39;s abused!</p>
<p>You can also authenticate to this site using Twitter, although that feature is in beta for now.</p>
