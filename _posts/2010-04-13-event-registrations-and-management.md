<p>Many organizations are looking to alleviate a lot of the stress and hours of work that comes with managing event registrations. Instead of dealing with hundreds or thousands of mailed-in registration forms, checks, cash, and manual credit card transactions, your organization can benefit from using an online event registration and management system.</p>
<p>These systems often perform the following tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Basic data collection (like other <a href="/wiki/basic-data-collection-onl">form builders</a>)</li>
<li>Payment processing (either through your own bank, a service like PayPal, or directly via credit card transactions)</li>
<li>Advanced registration management and data analysis</li>
<li>Customized form interfaces</li>
<li>Optional integration with your own website</li>
</ul>
<p>These systems typically charge a small fee per registration, and some may have a monthly or yearly subscription fee. Typically these services are best for those holding events with more than a few participants and where individuals must pay more than five or so dollars to register.</p>
<p>Here are a few of the best online event registration systems:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://doattend.com/">DoAttend</a></strong> - Pretty easy to use, and allows for e-ticketing. No monthly fees, and free for small/non-profit events.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.eventarc.com/">EventArc</a></strong> - Relatively easy to use, and has an impressive &#39;used by&#39; list. Again, free for small/non-profit events.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/">Eventbrite</a></strong> - This service has been around longer, but it&#39;s not quite as easy to use as some newer services. However, it is very robust.</li>
</ul>
