	Hi, I&#39;m helping create a new website for our youth group which is dedicated to developing open source software amongst many other projects. We are shifting to a Wordpress site (which we have pretty much completed) but want to base ourselves on LDAP so we can run concurrent CMSs. I&#39;m wondering if anyone can help us with the LDAP side of things? If interested to help please email rjzaar at yahoo dot com.</p>
