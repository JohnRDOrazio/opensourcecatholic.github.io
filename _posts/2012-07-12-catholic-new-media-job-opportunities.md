Lately there have been a few new job opportunities for Catholics who are in the tech realm and/or are looking to work with social/new media. Here are two I've heard about in the past week:

<ul>
	<li><strong><a href="http://brandonvogt.com/love-social-media-the-usscb-has-a-job-opening-for-you/">USCCB Social Media Specialist</a></strong>
For someone who loves the Church, can use social media tools effectively, and wants to help Cardinal Dolan figure out his iPad.</li>
	<li><strong><a href="http://www.flocknote.com/jobs">Flocknote Happiness Engineer &amp; New Media Product Sales Specialists</a></strong>
For people who like to help other people and teach others how to use new communications tools effectively.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

I'm happy to see that some dioceses and parishes are starting to really get on board with social media and a more potent online presenceâ€”there are a few dioceses who finally have full-time online representatives and incorporate online content strategy in communications and marketing campaigns!

Know of any other openings? Leave the info in the comments below.
