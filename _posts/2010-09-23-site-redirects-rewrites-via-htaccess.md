<p>Greetings,</p>
<p>I just moved a website to a completely new hosting provider AND CMS (Joomla to WordPress).</p>
<p>The problem is that I&#39;m getting a number of http requests that are obviously for the OLD site - variations like this - http://www.website.com/?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=3483&amp;Itemid=384</p>
<p>Is there any way to &#39;redirect&#39; these http requests to my new homepage (index.php). It would have to be a wildcard since there were over 3,000 articles on the old site.</p>
<p>To recap...is it possible to redirect http requests as follows</p>
<p>http://www.website.com/?option=com_content* to http://www.website.com</p>
<p>I&#39;m assuming this would need to be done via the .htaccess file.</p>
<p>Thanks for suggestions!</p>
