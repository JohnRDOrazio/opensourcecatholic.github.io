<p>From an <a href="http://www.todaysparish.com/Parish-social-media">article posted to Today&#39;s Parish</a>, from <a href="http://twitter.com/jongivens">@jongivens</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A few years ago, it would have been considered &ldquo;cutting edge&rdquo; for a parish to be using social media, but now everyone is doing it. So the question isn&rsquo;t should parishes be using social media, but how can they use it with intentionality to support their ministry goals. Before a minister or parish committee member even sets up a Twitter account, Facebook page, or blog for the parish, they need to discern what it is they are trying to accomplish with these new media tools.</p>
<p>In &ldquo;The Priest and Pastoral Ministry in a Digital World: New Media at the Service of the Word,&rdquo; Pope Benedict XVI outlined the importance of social media and the need for priests and lay people to adapt to this cultural shift. Using excerpts from the pope&rsquo;s letter as a framework, this article lays out three basic steps for creating a social media strategy for a parish or ministry organization:</p>
<ul>
<li>Define your goals</li>
<li>Meet your audience</li>
<li>Build your content</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Nothing we haven&#39;t heard before, but a good consideration for every parish and Catholic organization: <strong>what is your strategy for online communications</strong> (even more broad than simply social media use... you should also consider traditional email marketing, and website content management)?</p>
<p>Of course, I must contest the point that &#39;everybody&#39;s doing it&#39; when it comes to parishes and social media... <a href="http://www.opensourcecatholic.com/blog/oscatholic/study-shows-23-churches">fully 66% of churches don&#39;t use social media</a>&mdash;and that&#39;s all Christians. Catholic churches, I&#39;m sure, would see a smaller minority using social media.</p>
<p>I think the battle still needs to be fought over whether or not a parish should be using social media... not how they should use it (just yet ;-). Many priests and parish councils simply see no need for it at this point.</p>
