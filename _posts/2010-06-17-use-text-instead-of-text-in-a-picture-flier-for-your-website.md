<p>Make your information searchable, accessible, and reader-friendly... this is from <a href="http://archstldev.com/story/2010/use-text-instead-tex">a post on archstldev.com</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you perform a web search via Google, or in the search engine on any website in the world, your search is done using simple words, like &quot;bishop st. louis.&quot; A search engine must be able to see words like these in your pages if you want people to find your pages.</p>
<p>You need to have written text on the page (copied and pasted, or typed on the website) if you want people to be able to search for your information, and if you want people to be able to easily read and share your information.</p>
