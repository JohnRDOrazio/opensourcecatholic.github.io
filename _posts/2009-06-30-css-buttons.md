<p>I am actually new to css (it's easy) but I ran across problems building buttons.&nbsp; Currently they are simple buttons instead of pictures, I&nbsp;would like to use my buttons though.&nbsp; After trying severel different things I&nbsp;finally found out I&nbsp;need to put both the lit up button and un-lit button on the same picture, then tell the script to call a certain point on the picture.&nbsp; Am I&nbsp;correct or am I&nbsp;wasting my time?&nbsp; How do you guys line up your buttons on the same picture and easily know how to point to them with css? &nbsp; </p>
