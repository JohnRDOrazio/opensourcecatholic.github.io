<p>Does anyone know if there is an open source and/or free alternative to Microsoft Outlook and Exchange Server?&nbsp; I found Mozilla is beta-ing something called Sunbird.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/calendar/sunbird/index.html">http://www.mozilla.org/projects/calendar/sunbird/index.html</a>&nbsp; But this doesn't look to be able to book conference rooms or invite others to meetings, just a schedule sharing program.&nbsp; But it does link to a cool site that appears to have come calendars already created with the Catholic liturgical schedule.&nbsp; Has anyone used those before?&nbsp; <a href="http://icalshare.com/index.php?topic=religion&amp;page=2">http://icalshare.com/index.php?topic=religion&amp;page=2</a></p>
<p>Alternatively, has anyone seen a module or add-on for Joomla/Drupal that allows for the &quot;rooms to be booked&quot; feature.&nbsp; My parish has a big problem with people booking the same room at the same time.&nbsp; I'd like to just add it via the website(Joomla 1.4) but I haven't found anything like that(allowing multiple users to book, but not the same location at the same time).&nbsp; Basically exactly what Outlook does but not Outlook....&nbsp; :\</p>
