After almost eight years with Open Source Catholic as a Drupal 7 website hosted on infrastructure generously provided by [Midwestern Mac](http://www.midwesternmac.com/), I migrated _all_ the Drupal site content into a static Jekyll-powered site hosted on GitHub Pages (thanks to a suggestion from [Michael Bianco](https://github.com/iloveitaly)).

To maintain consistency we migrated _everything_, including comments and forum topics (we're now using Disqus for commenting), and made sure all the old link paths were redirected to the new Jekyll structure.

Please let us know if you find any problems on this new version of the site by adding an issue to the [Open Source Catholic](https://github.com/opensourcecatholic/opensourcecatholic.github.io) website repository on GitHub.
