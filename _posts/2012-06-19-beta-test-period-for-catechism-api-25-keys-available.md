A year ago, I registered the domain <strong>catholiccrossreference.com</strong> after my previous web site suffered a meltdown. This domain became the new home of my Catechism search engine (among other things).

Today, I am announcing the release of a Catechism API (still in beta).&nbsp; There is no documentation written for it yet, although the field names (and their values) are pretty straight-forward.

This API allows you to request information about the sections of the Catechism and to search the text of the Catechism by word or Scripture reference.&nbsp; In the near future, there will be both documentation and a sample display of how to render the JSON results in HTML.

There are 25 beta accounts available... probably highly optimistic on my part.
