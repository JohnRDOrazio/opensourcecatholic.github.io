<p>Over on my personal blog, I write about <a href="http://www.lifeisaprayer.com/articles/web-design/post-photos-from-ipad-to-drupal">how to post photos from the iPad to ImageFields on a Drupal site</a>. I intend to do so quite a bit this weekend on my visit to New York City (this will be my first trip without a laptop&mdash;yikes!).</p>
<p>I basically use Dropbox as a middleman to get a URL for the photo, which I can pass to FileField Sources so my Drupal site can use the photo. Unfortunately, for the time being, Mobile Safari doesn&#39;t support file select fields :-(</p>
