<p>This blog will be a forum to introduce and share information about free or low-cost (software, web applications and occasional hardware) solutions for libraries, non-profits, small businesses and others who want functionality and ease-of-use but at no cost or a very low cost. Our primary audience is people with low to average computer and Web skills, who would appreciate an easy-to-understand resource, a go-to place for free or low-cost solutions, and a place to exchange their success stories.</p>
