<p>Hello everyone! &nbsp;I finally joined (at Jeff's persistent urging). &nbsp;I'm excited to meet other Catholics who share the burden of building websites. &nbsp;I've been a web developer since 2002, and besides a short job I took after college, I've been working for Catholic companies doing web development ever since, and I've always been the only &quot;web guy&quot; around. &nbsp;This site is a good idea to connect all of us.</p>
<p>However, I'm a little confused &mdash; there seems to be too many ways to share and discuss on this site than my brain can compute: articles, wiki entries, blog posts, website posts, and forum posts. &nbsp;Where do I start?</p>
<p>I see the site is still &quot;beta&quot;, and Jeff said that's because he's not sure about all those content types, either. &nbsp;I think limiting to blog and forum entries would probably suffice. &nbsp;Write a blog entry if you want to share some interesting technique, insight, or success story (combining blogs, articles, and websites), and write a forum post if you just want to ask questions and gab.</p>
<p>What does everyone think?</p>
