<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Anyone here have any experience migrating ASP content to Joomla?</p>
<p>There's not a huge budget for this, but hopefully it's a 'simple' (yeah right!) job. </p>
<p>I'm building a Joomla site for a Catholic newspaper, but 2 years of content is sitting on their old hosting provider (Going1up.com). The last time I built a Joomla site for one of their previous customers, I got a CD&nbsp;with everything in an Access db. Since it wasn't a requirement to maintain/keep this info, we skipped it.</p>
<p>I can be reached at catholicservant@gmail.com. </p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>Craig</p>
