I have seen my friends(Youth) bringing mobile in church,which causes lot of distraction.I don't understand why the youth are so attached with mobile.We have 365 days with 24 hours and we don't worship God with our heart for 2-3 hours but worship the moble for long than they imagine.I am sick of seeing this kind of behaviour and want to write that bringing mobile to church is not a good thing.It causes distraction,and why do you bring mobile to church just for 2-3 hours.Even our catholic prist talks about the distraction caused by the mobile in church.So my catholic brothers and sisters(Youth and people) please we sholud not bring mobile to the church, to the Holy place of God.And we should pray with our full heart and soul.

If any user have any argument,question,and feed back sent message/mail me.Any suggestion by Open Source Catholic site please let me know.My e-mail address is :subbayoushaaveetadid@yahoo.co.uk
