<p>
	During this Easter season, I saw fit to spend a few hours on the OSC website, which has, I admit, taken a back seat to many of my other web projects, most notably the <a href="http://archstl.org/">Archdiocese of St. Louis website</a> and some other little projects I&#39;m dabbling in (like an experimental <a href="http://jeffgeerling.com/">HTML5 site</a>).</p>
<p>
	Here are some of the recent changes I&#39;ve made:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<strong><a href="/tweets/all">OSC Member Tweets</a> are back online!</strong><br />
		(I Installed an updated version of Drupal&#39;s Twitter module. Cron is now much faster, and old Tweets are cleared from the database, so I feel save using the module again).</li>
	<li>
		<strong><a href="/book/open-source-catholic-wiki">OSC Wiki Pages</a> are being added!</strong> (and anyone with an account can edit them!)<br />
		(Right now they&#39;re pretty sparse, but I plan on taking on the development of these pages as a personal project&mdash;mostly so I can have a nice resource to refer the poor helpless chaps that are burdened with parish/diocesan web development, but need help).</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Theming Issues are being cleaned up!</strong><br />
		(I&#39;ve spent a little more time working with the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/airyblue">Airy Blue</a> theme (on drupal.org) and fixing small theming issues I&#39;ve found on OSC, in particular).</li>
</ul>
<p>
	BUT, most importantly, <strong>the &#39;Beta&#39; status of this site has been removed</strong>! I figure almost a year into the site&#39;s existence, it is time. Check out the new and improved (and 5 KB lighter) header at the top of this page!</p>
<p>
	Any other suggestions? Comments are welcome :)</p>
