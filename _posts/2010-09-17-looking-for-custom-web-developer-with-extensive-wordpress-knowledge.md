<p>I am looking for a custom web developer to transform my current website (www.thecatholichour.org) into a custom website based on the Wordpress CMS. The end product will most likely be a custom CMS based on Wordpress as my site will require multiple databases. My original webmaster is too tied up to work within my current timeframe of 2-3 weeks to get essential components up and running followed by a Phase II which will require more customized work on the site.</p>
<p>Here are essential components:</p>
<p>The following feature set would be best for a 1.0 / phase I release:</p>
<p>Video Archive<br />
News Articles Archive<br />
Podcast Archive<br />
Article Archive<br />
Paypal Donate Button<br />
Design Integration with Wordpress<br />
Calendar<br />
Contact Form<br />
MailChimp (newsletter) signup<br />
Basic Buddy Press Configuration<br />
Frontpage customization<br />
My original web developer relayed that Phase I will cost $500 with an estimated 3 week timeline, although some things should be up and running within a couple of days so I can start adding content quickly He said: &quot;After I get the different components in place on the test site I&#39;ll start working up a design and then implementing the design through the various sections of the site. After the design is in place I&#39;ll move onto customizations to the front page and custom page work such as the donate + contact forms.&quot; That sounds reasonable to me.</p>
<p>Phase II - III would contain features such as:</p>
<p>Shopping cart<br />
Map Feature (showing where followers are located, locations of calendar events and locations of local Fulton Sheen Societies)<br />
Interactive Calendar<br />
Buddy Press customization<br />
Fulton Sheen Society subsite (small subsite with diffferent header, top navigation, similar layout to The Catholic Hour)<br />
Please send me a message if you are qualified and up for the task and we can discuss further.</p>
<p>Thank you and God bless you.&nbsp;</p>
