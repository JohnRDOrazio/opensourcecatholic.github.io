<p>[<em>Good post on making a self-published book &mdash;Ed.</em>]</p>
<p>When I&nbsp;began writing a book on the liturgy back in March of this year, I&nbsp;was looking for ways of getting it in print easily and cheaply.&nbsp; I&nbsp;have no funny letters after my name, which means I have received no degrees (or schooling at all, for that matter)&nbsp;in the realm of liturgical studies.&nbsp; But I&nbsp;didn't want that to stop me from getting my research out to the people.</p>
<p>I&nbsp;considered <a href="http://www.lulu.com/"><strong>lulu.com</strong></a> at first, because I had heard good things about it through the Church Music Association of America.&nbsp; Unfortunately, my experience with lulu was plagued by unexplained error messages, customer service that was at least a week behind, and expenses that, while not prohibitive, were disheartening.</p>
<p>It was in the forums on lulu.com that I&nbsp;found out about Amazon.com's print-on-demand division, <a href="http://www.createspace.com/"><strong>CreateSpace.com</strong></a>.&nbsp; Because they are directly connected with Amazon, there is no additional fee for listing the book on Amazon.&nbsp; (The royalties you get through Amazon are less than through the CreateSpace portal, but that's a small price to pay for such visibility.)&nbsp; CreateSpace is barebones when compared to lulu (which provides many additional services, some free, some not), but it was more than sufficient for my needs.&nbsp; The <strong>one</strong> additional expense CreateSpace got me to accept was a one-time $39 fee which results in increased royalties and a reduced price for buying my own book.&nbsp; That $39 will pay for itself in a matter of days.</p>
<!--break-->
<p>In the end, after only <strong>a single day</strong> of having the book in print, I&nbsp;have earned in royalties totalling over 33% of my total expenses in creating and promoting the book.</p>
<p>I&nbsp;would definitely recommend CreateSpace.com to anyone looking to publish a softcover book with minimal hassle and maximum returns-on-investment.</p>
<p>My book, <a href="http://www.prayingthemass.com/"><em>Praying the Mass: The Prayers of the People</em></a>, will be appearing on Amazon.com in a week or two.&nbsp; Until then, it can be purchased through <a href="https://www.createspace.com/3393711">my CreateSpace portal</a>.</p>
