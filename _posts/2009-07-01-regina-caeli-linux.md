<p>An idea that's been floating in my head for some time.&nbsp; I&nbsp;don't really consider myself a linux developer, butI know what I&nbsp;like, and I&nbsp;have some idea just what tends to attract users.&nbsp; So, without further ado:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regina Caeli Linux J+M+J <br />
<br />
Mission Statement:&nbsp; to develop a Linux distribution that helps Catholics live their faith in obedience to the Magisterium, and appeals to as many people as possible.<br />
<br />
Papa Ben has said he wants the Gospel proclaimed on the Internet; surely this is part of it.<br />
<br />
<em>In omnibus caritas</em>.&nbsp; Madeline L'Engle once said &quot;We do not draw people to Christ by loudly discrediting what they believe, by telling them how wrong they are and how right we are, but by showing them a light that is so lovely that they want with all their hearts to know the source of it.&quot;&nbsp; This is how we make RC Linux appealing.<br />
<br />
Ubuntu based; Ubuntu is easily one of the most appealing linux distros out there.&nbsp; Its ease of use especially contributes to this.&nbsp; Codenames could be taken from apparitions of Our Lady, e.g. Guadeloupe, Akita, Knock, the Immaculate Conception, La Sallette, Lourdes, the Angels, and so on.<br />
<br />
We want it beautified; one of the most common complaints about Ubuntu is that it's ugly.&nbsp; This is important.&nbsp; One way that Catholics distinguish themselves from many Protestants (esp in these United States) is by getting beauty right.&nbsp; The Sabily team has made Ubuntu very beautiful (see review at http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,2845,2347168,00.asp ).&nbsp; Surely we can do as well.&nbsp; Eye candy has a lot of appeal.<br />
<br />
One idea I have for this is to set up an autotheming script, to theme the desktop in accordance with the colors of the Liturgical calendar:&nbsp; green, gold, purple, red, and rose.&nbsp; Themes should include color coordinated window decorations, highlights and selections, Clearlooks widgets, icons, and wallpaper.<br />
<br />
DansGuardian fronted by Webstrict, or else pull MintNanny.<br />
<br />
Software for the liturgical calendar (requires localization), Rosary, Liturgy of the Hours, Daily readings (requires localization), Saint of the day (requires localization), GnomeSword with Douay-Rheims Challonier and King James Version with apocrypha.&nbsp; Other devotional applets in the repos could include Ignatian, Sacred Heart, Immaculate Heart, the Infant of Prague, Sacred Blood, etc.<br />
<br />
Customized IceWeasel -- not just customized homepage, but a whackload of links built in:&nbsp; apologetics, catechesis, spirituality, faith and morals, canon law, history, saints, etc.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Ad Majorem Dei Gloriam!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Random Thoughts:&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;sometimes think that part of the failure of Ubuntu Christian&nbsp;Edition was its attempt to appeal to (and so, in some ways reconcile) believers with utterly incompatible beliefs.&nbsp; Narrowing the focus to the One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic church ought to help make this a better distro than Ubuntu CE.</p>
