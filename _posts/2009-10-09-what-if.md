<p>What if the USCCB offered the Bible via an API so programmers/iPhone App developers/web developers could query a verse or chapter for display/search?</p>
<p>What if the Vatican offered better searching, indexing, and referencing for their vast library of Papal encyclicals, Church Council documents, and other other messages?</p>
<p>What if the USCCB offered, perhaps, some sort of 'widget' for displaying a random bible quote, the day's readings (or a blurb from said readings), and other Bible-related topics on people's blogs, websites, etc.?</p>
<p>I really hope these kinds of things become reality, and sooner rather than later. Does anyone know if these kinds of issues are even on the radar?</p>
<p>I'd also like to find out more about how our Church is working towards the lofty goals set forth in <em>Inter Mirifica</em>, the letters for the World Day of Communication each year, etc., besides implementing a YouTube channel and Facebook app. I'll volunteer time to help accomplish some of these goals&mdash;can't we bring some of these projects into the 'open source' sphere? The dogmas of the Church are not 'open source,' but couldn't the technologies be more so?</p>
