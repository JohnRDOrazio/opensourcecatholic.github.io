Hey everyone,

My parish has finally decided to redo their website and are going with Drupal as the CMS. I wanted to be able to provide them with some examples of parishes who are using Drupal the right way. So I was wondering if anyone had examples of good parish website using Drupal. Also if anyone had some theme suggestions that would work well for a parish.

Thanks in advance.
Jason
