Rather than try to build and maintain a directory of Catholic apps here, we'd like to focus on tools and resources for building, maintaining and promoting apps. However, if you'd like to browse listings of Catholic Apps, here are a few great resources:

<ul>
	<li><a href="http://catholicapps.com/">Catholic@pps.com</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://catholicapps.wordpress.com/">Catholic Apps</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://catholictechtalk.com/mobile-apps/">Catholic Tech Talk - Mobile Applications</a></li>
</ul>
