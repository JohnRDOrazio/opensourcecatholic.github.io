<p>From the <a href="http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/1004179.htm">CNS</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pope Benedict XVI unveiled a new Vatican agency to promote &quot;new evangelization&quot; and assigned it the task of combating the &quot;de-Christianization&quot; of countries that were first evangelized centuries ago.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>...and of special interest to Open Source Catholic readers, it looks like this agency will work especially through the means of modern communications media, such as social networking:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The archbishop said the council would work closely with modern communications media -- an explicit request of the pope -- and that the council&#39;s staff would operate in several languages.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Pope&#39;s apostolic letter went on to speak of the importance of religious values and family in society, and mourns the loss of community and the fact that many live in an &quot;interior desert&quot; as a result of relativism and modernism.</p>
<p>Very poignant; we&#39;ll see what comes of this!</p>
