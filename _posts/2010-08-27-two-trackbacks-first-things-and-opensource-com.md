<p>Recently, this site has had a nice influx of visitors from the following two articles:</p>
<p>1. <a href="http://www.firstthings.com/blogs/firstthoughts/2010/08/04/sources-for-open-sources/">First Things / First Thoughts: Sources for Open Sources</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I stumbled across Open Source Catholic while looking for something entirely different, and as our webmaster says it looks like a useful site, pass it along. It includes stories with mysterious titles like Drupal Gardens enters Open Public Beta and understandable ones like Live-Blogging to Drive Traffic, Interest to Organizational Events. Some of you may find it useful.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>2. <a href="http://opensource.com/life/10/8/give-me-some-old-time-open-source-religion?sc_cid=70160000000IDmjAAG">opensource.com: Give me some of that old-time, open source religion</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A reader tossed us a link to opensourcecatholic.com. This of course raised the question&mdash;which Google happily answered: Is there an intersection between open source and religion? 8,910,000 results say yes. Whether you have a church home, a home church, or simply some spiritual foundation that you hold to because you believe it, it&rsquo;s likely that this faith is helped by fellowship, and educated through both doctrine and some form of social networking. What you believe&mdash;the specifics of it at least&mdash;is usually information that needs to be explored, maintained, and perhaps shared.</p>
