<p>Hit the Apple store at Ridgedale around 11am this morning. Place was packed. Line for Snow Leopard was about 5 deep but moving pretty quickly.</p>
<p>Grabbed Subway, then to the home office to do some loading.</p>
<p>I thought I read somewhere that's it's a 15-20 minute upgrade...uh uh. Took almost an hour. While I was waiting, I putzed around on my XP machine while watching the Macbook out of the corner of my eye.</p>
<p>After a few reboots...upgrade complete.</p>
<p>I haven't really tried anything yet, but I did note shutdown and startup times.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shutdown - 5 seconds (no open applications)</p>
<p>Startup - 75 seconds</p>
<p>It's possible that the first shutdown/startup sequence may still be shuffling some bits and in the future it'll be even faster...but I'm pleased. Opening up applications seem a bit snappier.</p>
<p>I've got a 17&quot; MacBook Pro (2008 model), 2.5 Ghz Intel Dual-core with 4GB of RAM. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Looking forward to trying out the Exchange Server integration, see if it actually works. I've been dropping into Parallels to run Outlook 2007...and even though it's bearable running a VM, I'd prefer not to.</p>
<p>Anyone else moving to SL?</p>
