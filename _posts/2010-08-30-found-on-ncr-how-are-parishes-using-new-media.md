<p>From Matthew Warner&#39;s blog on the National Catholic Register website: <a href="http://www.ncregister.com/blog/how-are-parishes-using-new-media/">How are parishes using new media?</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Last week I asked my Twitter followers for some examples of parishes using new media. I got some good ones, which I was pleased with. So thank you fellow tweeters!</p>
<p>But I must admit that, <strong>overall, I was a bit disappointed in my search</strong>. I also &ldquo;googled&rdquo; the topic fairly extensively and the pickin&rsquo;s were few. I hope that one day when we google &ldquo;Catholic Parish,&rdquo; we are blown away with how impressed we are with the many, many great results we find. In the meantime, we have some learning, sharing and working to do! Keep in mind I am looking for new media being applied specifically to the life of the parish, not simply its use in various other ministries by those in the Church.</p>
<p>I tried to capture a good variety of new media applications that parishes might find useful. But I hope it doesn&rsquo;t stop there. I hope leaders of parishes will be contacting these parishes, asking them what works and what doesn&rsquo;t and all taking some steps forward together. I also pray that the laity who have been blessed with the ability to produce and apply new media will come forward and fulfill an important roll in their Church.</p>
