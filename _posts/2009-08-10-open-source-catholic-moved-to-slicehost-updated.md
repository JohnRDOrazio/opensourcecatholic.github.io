<p>[<strong>Update</strong>: An article on Midwestern Mac explaining <a href="http://www.midwesternmac.com/blogs/geerlingguy/getting-oscs-drupal-install-optimized-slicehost">how I optimized the Slice to serve up OSC without any huge resource-hogging</a>.]</p>
<p>If you can see this article, you're seeing Open Source Catholic served up fresh from <a href="http://www.slicehost.com/">Slicehost</a>; all the sites I'm running will eventually be moved over... but for now, I'm working to optimize the Slice using Open Source Catholic as a test site.</p>
<p>In a short time, I'll post some of my problems/solutions, as well as thoughts on hosting providers, for the benefit of other Catholic webdevs looking to save a buck or two and have the best server setup possible!</p>
<p>Want to help offset hosting costs for Open Source Catholic, and use a great host? (Wow, that sounds like market-ese for you!)
