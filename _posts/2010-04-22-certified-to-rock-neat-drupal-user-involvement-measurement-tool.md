<p>Just found this cool tool to see how involved (&quot;Certified to Rock&quot;) you might be, in the Drupal community. The tool will be getting some updates soon, but for now, if you are a drupal.org user, check your username on <a href="http://certifiedtorock.com/">Certified to Rock.com</a>, and see how you rank!</p>
