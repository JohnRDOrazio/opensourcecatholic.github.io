<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been testing out Drupal, to see if I want to use it to rebuild an old Joomla site I maintain.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve got CKEditor and CKFinder working for content editing and image uploads.&nbsp; They work great.&nbsp; When I am editing the post, the image appears, I can move it around, etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem comes in when I view or preview the post.&nbsp; Images do not appear.&nbsp; The IMG tage is absent in the HTML source that is displayed, for example, on the home page.&nbsp; Yet if I go back and edit the content item, the image is still there, just as I placed it.</p>
<p>Any ideas about where to look?&nbsp; Searches in Google and the Drupal Forums are too full of discussions about image modules, etc.&nbsp; I can&#39;t find an answer.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance,<br />
-Jason</p>
