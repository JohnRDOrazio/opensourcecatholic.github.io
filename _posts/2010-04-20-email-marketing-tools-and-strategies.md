<p>Here are some recommended email marketing tools:</p><ul><li><a href="http://www.mailchimp.com/">MailChimp</a></li><li><a href="http://www.constantcontact.com/">Constant Contact</a></li><li><a href="http://www.aweber.com/">Aweber</a></li><li><a href="http://www.myemma.com/">Emma</a></li><li><a href="http://www.pb.com/email-marketing-software/" target="_blank">pbSmart Connections</a></li></ul><p>Before beginning any email marketing campaigns, you should make sure you are committed to the following:</p><ul><li>Allowing users to easily subscribe and unsubscribe, at any time, and always include a method of unsubscribing in your emails (most services do this automatically).</li><li>Writing proper English, and keeping things concise; people spend about as much time reading emails as web pagesâ€”almost none.</li><li>Using graphics/images sparingly; many email recipients won't even be able to view images. You should never have important copy inside a graphic.</li><li>Keep designs simple, so they will work effectively in as many email clients as possible.</li><li>Avoid or use the word "free" minimally in your subject and email content as it often triggers spam filters.</li></ul><p>$STUB$</p>
