	OK...I&#39;m sure this is an EASY one for the designers here...</p>
<p>
	Most of the sites I&#39;ve built have used fairly simple gradient backgrounds, with small sliced images to reduce load time.</p>
<p>
	Now, I&#39;ve found some great textures in the .pat format (Photoshop patterns) that I&#39;d like to use. My problem is they&#39;re quite large and I&#39;m still learning my way around Photoshop (still using Fireworks primarily).</p>
<p>
	These patterns are 740x740 (and larger)...but even if I compress them heavily...they&#39;re still around 100-300kb. Any suggestions?</p>
<p>
	Here&#39;s a link to the images: http://webtreatsetc.deviantart.com/art/Retro-Grunge-Wallpaper-Pattens-125020804</p>

	TIA,</p>
