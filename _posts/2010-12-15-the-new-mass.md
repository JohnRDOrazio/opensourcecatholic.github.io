<p>So, <a href="http://www.opensourcecatholic.com/blog/oscatholic/open-source-catholic-cha">this post</a> reminded me of a project I always thought would be useful, but never really embarked upon.&nbsp; Maybe by mentioning it here, someone may think it interesting enough to start on.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve always thought it would be a good idea to have either a piece of software (as cross platform as possible) or a Website that teaches about the Mass.&nbsp; It could have the parts of the Mass that can then be expanded to the actual texts, parts of the bible where the texts come from, commentaries, overall summary, etc..&nbsp; You know, something that someone can point newcomers to the Church to.</p>
<p>Given that we&#39;re transitioning to the new revision of the Mass, now might be a good time to start such a project with the new texts.</p>
<p>If one went the web route, I wouldn&#39;t recommend HTML5 as this would need to be as accessible to as many people as possible.&nbsp; But maybe someone would like to work on it.&nbsp; I MIGHT be able to find some time to help.</p>
