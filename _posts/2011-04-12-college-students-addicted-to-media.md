<p><a href="http://www.good.is/post/i-was-itching-like-a-crackhead-study-finds-college-students-addicted-to-media">This article</a> gives us reason for pause:</p><blockquote><p>What do college students in China, Chile, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Uganda have in common? According to a new global study by the University of Maryland's International Center for Media &amp; the Public Affairs (ICMPA) and the Salzburg Academy on Media &amp; Global Change, they're all addicted to media. That might not seem like news—after all, there's a reason the term "CrackBerry" came into being—but just how severely students are addicted is startling, and has real implications for our schools where Skyping, blogging, learning-via-gaming technology is increasingly the norm.</p></blockquote><p>How do we engage an audience that is quite immersed in the world of technology, social media, etc., and bring them into a real, physical and emotional relationship with other humans, and even more importantly, the real and life-giving presence of Jesus Christ?</p><p>Just as in all things in our current state of being, we should be "in the world, but not of it."</p><p>Another side note: If college students are so addicted to media, I can guarantee that many, if not most, have had a large amount of exposure to pornography. This bodes ill for our cultural values in the coming years.</p>
