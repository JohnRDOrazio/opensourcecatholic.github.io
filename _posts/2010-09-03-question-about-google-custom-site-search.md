<p>Hello,</p>
<p>One of the sites I support is moving to a new host and a new redesign next week.</p>
<p>The current site has been running a <a href="http://www.google.com/cse/">Google Custom Search Engine</a>, and will be on the redesigned site.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The old/current site is going to be moved to a sub-domain for archival purposes: archives.mywebsite.com, and that&#39;ll need to be indexed going forward as well.</p>
<p>The question is how to handle the cutover.</p>
<p>Do I have to do anything specific in regards to telling Google to use the &#39;new&#39; site index instead of the old?</p>
<p>Do I have to go into Google Webmaster Tools and re-verify mywebsite.com and archives.mywebsite.com?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>
<p>Craig</p>
