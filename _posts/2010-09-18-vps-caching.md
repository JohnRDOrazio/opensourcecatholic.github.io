<p>I&#39;m looking at installing APC (Alternative PHP Cache) on one of the VPS&#39;es I support.</p>
<p>After doing some research, it sounds like it doesn&#39;t play nice with mod_suPHP, which I have installed as well.</p>
<p>Anyone have any experience with those 2?</p>
<p>The VPS - currently - only has 2 websites on it, one is a WordPress site, the other is Joomla.</p>
<p>Also, anyone using a CDN to offload content? Is it pricey</p>
<p>Thanks for any advice!&nbsp;</p>
