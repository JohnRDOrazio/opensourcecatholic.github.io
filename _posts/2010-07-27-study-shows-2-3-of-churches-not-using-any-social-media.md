<p>Buzzplant (a social media firm) recently surveyed thousands of Churches (it was a general survey, so not just Catholics), asking what forms of social communications they were using to communicate with their parishioners. Here&#39;s a summary of the results:</p>
<ul>
<li>62% of Churches post homilies to website as text or podcast</li>
<li>28% of Churches have a Pastor&#39;s Blog</li>
<li>32% of Churches use social media in one way or another</li>
<li>25% of Churches use social media to promote parish events [really? this should probably be the highest statistic, imo]</li>
</ul>
<p>You can view the full <a href="http://www.buzzplant.com/site/surveys/survey_results_church_sm.pdf">report on Churches&#39; use of social communications tools</a> (PDF) from Buzzplant. With the USCCB having recently released its <a href="http://www.usccb.org/comm/social-media-guidelines.shtml">proposed guidelines for social media use</a>, and with many Archdioceses effectively using <a href="/blog/geerlingguy/us-archdioceses-and-dioceses-twit">Twitter</a> and <a href="/blog/oscatholic/us-archdioceses-and-dioceses-faceb">Facebook</a> to spread the gospel, the time is ripe to use social media on the parish level, and integrate it with parish websites.</p>
