<p>[<em>This post offers up some interesting topics for discussion &mdash; Ed.</em>]</p>
<p>As a faithful Catholic who embraces the Internet and the whole Web 2.0 &quot;movement,&quot; I am always amazed at how totally liberal and anti-religion many of the bright folks in this field are. Just today I was reading the great website TechCrunch, when I came across this <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/08/22/nsfw-say-what-you-like-about-the-google-books-kool-aid-but-it-tastes-much-better-than-microsofts-sour-grapes/">article by Paul Carr</a>, who wrote:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;If this were a column about religious affairs, I would undoubtedly focus this week on the shocking news that Beelzebub himself has joined a coalition opposing child abuse in the Catholic church.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's clear that in Mr. Carr's mind there isn't the possiblity that one of the readers on his site might be a faithful Catholic who is offended by such a jab. Oh, well. Anticatholicsm is as old as the hills and the haters of the Church will always use the clergy sexual abuse scandal to slam the Gospel.</p>
<p>Any thoughts???</p>
