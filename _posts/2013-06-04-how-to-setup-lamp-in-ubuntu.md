Hello all, 

I recently finished a tutorial on how to setup Ubuntu 13.04 as a web server for local sites hosted within the users account. 

I have switched to Ubuntu 13.04 running on my Dell XPS13 and it is amazing. Clean fast "open" :-)

Setting up Apache to serve my local sites was not very straight forward, so I decided to make a tutorial that should get anyone up and running in about 10 to 15 minutes.
