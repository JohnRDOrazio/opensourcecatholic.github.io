<p>I am looking for tips on how to select a Joomla template.&nbsp; I have found many websites that have them, some for free, and some for a fee.&nbsp; But they look pretty similar to me - how can I decide?&nbsp;&nbsp; I don&#39;t mind paying a nominal fee if for some reason it&#39;s better.</p>
<p>The template is for a church website.&nbsp; I want to be able to use my own banner, and to adjust the color scheme (if necessary) to match the banner.&nbsp; I want users who do not know html to be able to update the site, and I want to be able to limit which user can edit which page.&nbsp; I think those are all characteristics of any Joomla template, so that&#39;s why I&#39;m confused about how to decide which is best.</p>
<p>I have experience using Kompozer, writing html, and using CSS.&nbsp; I&#39;m less skilled with PhotoShop (but there are others on the team that are more experienced with it - the banner is being made by a graphic artist).&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you can tell, this is my first attempt at using Joomla.&nbsp; Any advice on selecting a template would be much appreciated!</p>
