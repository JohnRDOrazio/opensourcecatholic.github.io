<p>So, here are some of my concerns about diving into the freelance field after I officially lose my job (which seems to be taking longer than expected, which is a good thing, while at the same time quite frustrating).</p>
<p><strong>Here are some questions I have:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Do I get a vendors license, do I incorporate, or do I just report the extra income on my personal taxes???</li>
    <li>What program do you use to do your invoices? (I've found some descent invoice templates for OpenOffice 3)</li>
    <li>Do you list the web hosting in your own name, or do you put it in your client's name and let them take care of the hosting themselves (after you have set it up for them?)</li>
    <li>What all do you include in your agreement contract?</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks and God Bless,</p>
<p>Joshua</p>
