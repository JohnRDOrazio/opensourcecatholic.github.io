<p>Today I was browsing around the Mac App Store, glancing around to see some of the Apps available a few days post-launch (I didn't do this earlier because I was working on my own appâ€”more on this later).</p>
<p>What I found surprised and elated me:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://www.opensourcecatholic.com/sites/opensourcecatholic.com/files/user-uploads/oscatholic/catholic-calendar-mac-app-store.png" alt="Catholic Calendar Mac Store App in Listings" width="600" height="305" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Looks like the '<a href="http://www.universalis.com/n-macapp-operationC.htm">Catholic Calendar</a>' application, developed by <a href="http://www.universalis.com/">Universalis</a>, is shown as one of the featured 'Lifestyle' applications, and is even the icon tile for the Categories overview page.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It'd be nice if the app had a more Catholic icon (the Latin text just doesn't set it off for me... look at the other icons - most of them are very simple/pleasing, and convey more meaning), but I'll take what I can get!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Does anyone else have a Catholic Mac App out there yet? Additionally, does anyone know who works with Universalis to keep on top of the game in this area? They've been doing a smash-up job lately in the mobile and desktop application world, amidst a field of thousands of other apps.</p>
