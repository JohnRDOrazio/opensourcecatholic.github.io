<p>I have searched all over for help on this CSS issue ( I assume is a css issue), it is not directly related to Catholic media but I have nowhere else to go.</p>
<p>I have a site: yardandattic.com, and the nodes have an imagefield (set to a max of 4). When viewing the node, the pictures are aligned vertically or stacked, I would like them to be horizontal or in-line. I have played with the style.css for the bluemarine Drupal theme but nothing affects the pictures. I am using lightbox on the images...any ideas? You can view a test page below...</p>
