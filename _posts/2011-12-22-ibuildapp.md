Has anyone used&nbsp;<a href="http://ibuildapp.com/">http://ibuildapp.com/</a>&nbsp;to quickly put together mobile applications for multiple platforms? If so how do you like it etc?

I used appinventor back in January to put together an Android application, but Google will no longer support it after Dec 31st.

Thanks!
