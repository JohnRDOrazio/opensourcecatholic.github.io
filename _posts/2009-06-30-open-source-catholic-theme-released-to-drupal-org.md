<p>What is open source without people who freely give of their time to make open source projects better? It's no source at all!</p>
<p>In the spirit of good stewardship and Christian charity, the code/files in the Open Source Catholic website's theme was released today (around 1 a.m.!) on drupal.org as &quot;<a href="http://drupal.org/project/airyblue">Airy Blue</a>,&quot; a 'contrib' theme. This allows anyone browsing Drupal's directory of themes to download it and use it on his own site!</p>
<p>We encourage everyone to think about how many benefits they derive from open source projects like Drupal, Wordpress, GIMP, and Linux distros every day, and to give back in any way they can... even if it's just a few bucks for beer!</p>
