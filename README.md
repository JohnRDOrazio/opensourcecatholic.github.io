# Open Source Catholic

This Jekyll project powers http://www.opensourcecatholic.com/

Open Source Catholic's mission is to help Catholic developers and organizations involved in software and web development find effective solutions for spreading the Gospel of Jesus Christ.

## Website History

The website was originally built on Drupal 7, and ran with a forum, user blogs and project listings for almost eight years before it was migrated to a static Jekyll site, with comments migrated from Drupal to Disqus.

You can contribute content to Open Source Catholic following the guide in CONTRIBUTING.md.
